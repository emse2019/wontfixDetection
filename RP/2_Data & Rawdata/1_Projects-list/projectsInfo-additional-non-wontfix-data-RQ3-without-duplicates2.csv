I have taken a look into your code and i believe the issue is with the AttachCyclicNavigationProperty method as it gets 2 parentNavigationProperty, Recipe and ComponentRecipe as they have the same Type. This then sets the parent Recipe for both of these on the RecipeLine. This messes up the entity and saves an incorrect entity into the database.  I have temporarily fixed this in my project by removing this line. I am not sure i need this line myself as I do not use the returned attached object anyway but it would be nice if this was resolved if possible.  Chris ","C#"

","C#"
"zzzprojects/GraphDiff","https://github.com/zzzprojects/GraphDiff","https://github.com/zzzprojects/GraphDiff/issues/37",NA," I added a failing test. The setup is actually quite simple: just an entity with an associate but both (entity and associate) also are part of a 'group' which in turn is associated to both of them (thus creating a cycle). And that's where it fails. The ObjectStateManager complains that it can't track two entities with the same key as soon as the second entity is attached (because it contains an indirect reference to the first which has already been attached). A proposed fix (based on your idea <em>g</em>) is to just attach a key only object.  There is one small drawback though: the persisted (and thus returned) object no longer equals (neither reference nor content) the one passed in because I had to replace the reference before setting it in the persisted parent or I'd still have duplicates in my set as soon as change tracking got turned back on. I also did that for the 2nd caller of AttachAndReload (associated collection elements) but there aren't any tests covering that yet (no test turned red when I had not replaced the added collection element).  I think the side effect of reference inequality should be okay as there are a couple of other places new'ing up ""persisted"" instances, e.g. missing owned associated entities, missing collections (both, owned and associated) and the root entity.  I'm not so sure if you're thinking about the side effect of not attaching the whole sub graph I'd anticipate code relying on it to attach cycle-free sub graphs without explicitly mapping them. On the other hand I don't believe such code to be correct (and safe) as it might attach parts of the graph that aren't mapped at all or are mapped as associated but without guaranteeing the behavior as changes in implicitly attached sub graphs will be saved as well.  As far as semver is concerned a new major version might be the right thing to do nonetheless.  I also found and fixed another bug for an edge case. I have an associated entity but the association is stored inside that entity (foreign key field). So I need to update the entity to update the association. So far everything is okay and working just fine. But my associated entity has another association which is [Required]. So if I want to update the association (and thus the associated entity) I've to attach that second association as well. Which is impossible to map with the current API because AssociatedCollections can't have associations. My proposed bug fix automatically detects such cases (required associations) and attaches them as well. I've also added a test to demonstrate my problem. ","C#"

If i visit the tracking station, i have a huge loading time, then disable the grid overlay, go back, it takes time to load again. Then, i enter it again with the overlay off, it loads almost as without kethane installed, and exiting seems to work fine too. As soon i enable it, here it goes again.  I also noticed that when it's on, and i change the view to a different body, it lags for a second, while with 7.7 it's barely noticable. So, i guess it is because of the new terrain conforming grid loading everytime i change the body focus or scene. And the same thing happens in the main menu, loading Kerbin and overlay in the background, hence the loading time on the start and going back from the space center(but you already know that).  Here's the output log:<br><a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3Ttot_vYYGVU3ZJcmFPb1Y5d2s/edit?usp=sharing"">https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3Ttot_vYYGVU3ZJcmFPb1Y5d2s/edit?usp=sharing</a>  I'm on Win7 64bit, 4gb of ram, Athlon II X4 2.9Ghz, store version of the game.

The problem is more pronounced when 4x symmetry or higher is enabled. If you hammer away at the mouse button it will sometimes <em>eventually</em> allow the part to be placed.

This is of course a bit cheaty, but the logic could be improved upon, e.g. depending of the mass /TWR of the vessel that has the grappling node, which would in turn raise questions on how you calculate the TWR of a mobile crane which is essentially a rover and has no real TWR... let's just introduce tugs as a general concept into KAS and sort out the fine print later, eh?  One thing that could really be an issue: I have no idea how the game / KAS reacts if a part that is already attached via a grappler (and effectively already part of the vessel gets attached again via a node. If that becomes a problem, it could be solved <ul><li>by detaching the grappling node at the same time the part is attached to the vessel</li><li>by stipulating that one can not attach a part to vessels that are already grappling it (but that would break manipulator arms to no end)</li><li>by stipulating that the grappler may only be near the part but not actually connected to it to count (which would be kinda stupid)</li></ul>","C#"

Every 14 days a second RSA key (SSK) is generated and exposed via the well known endpoint. 24 hours after the SSK is created, we begin signing tokens with it. 24 hours after signing begins with the SSK, the PSK is removed and the SSK is promoted to the PSK. In general it takes 48 hours to complete a key roll.  We're experiencing an issue with middleware being unable to validate tokens. This issue seems to occur during key rolling, at the point the SSK starts signing. The exception in the middleware is <blockquote> Authentication failed System.IdentityModel.Tokens.SecurityTokenSignatureKeyNotFoundException </blockquote> It appears the issue is that the middleware receives a token, signed with a key it doesn't know about (SSK).  I've done some digging and hopefully the following is accurate. We're using the 2.14.0 middleware. The following class implements the caching for the middleware, with a default cache time of 1 day. If I understand the behavior correctly, the middleware will retrieve keys at startup, and roughly every 24 hours thereafter.  <a href=""https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer3.AccessTokenValidation/blob/master/source/AccessTokenValidation/Plumbing/DiscoveryDocumentIssuerSecurityTokenProvider.cs"">https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer3.AccessTokenValidation/blob/master/source/AccessTokenValidation/Plumbing/DiscoveryDocumentIssuerSecurityTokenProvider.cs</a>  To perform the actual key retrieval, the middleware calls into to configuration manager: <pre><code>private void RetrieveMetadata(){	if (_syncAfter &gt;= DateTimeOffset.UtcNow)	{		return;	}	_synclock.EnterWriteLock();	try	{		var result = AsyncHelper.RunSync(async () =&gt; await _configurationManager.GetConfigurationAsync());		...</code></pre> The 2.14.0 package depends on <code>&lt;package id=""Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocol.Extensions"" version=""1.0.2.206221351"" targetFramework=""net45"" /&gt;</code>, which contains the code for ConfigurationManager here:  <a href=""https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/blob/1.0.2.206221351/src/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocol.Extensions/Configuration/ConfigurationManager.cs"">https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/blob/1.0.2.206221351/src/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocol.Extensions/Configuration/ConfigurationManager.cs</a>  It appears this code is caching as well, with a default time of 5 days. If this is correct, it could be 6 days before the middleware picks up new keys. Updated versions of <code>ConfigurationManager&lt;T&gt;</code> use a 1 day cache.  <a href=""https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/blob/master/src/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols/Configuration/ConfigurationManager.cs"">https://github.com/AzureAD/azure-activedirectory-identitymodel-extensions-for-dotnet/blob/master/src/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Protocols/Configuration/ConfigurationManager.cs</a> ","C#"

This ensures that only one thread can initialize Lazy, but this also caches exception in case it is thrown during initialization. So all subsequent calls to Lazy.Value will experience the same cached exception thrown every time. In this case the only way to ""heal"" a micro-service is restart.  I would suggest to use <code>LazyThreadSafetyMode.PublicationOnly</code> mode:  multiple threads can invoke the initialization logic but the first thread to complete the initialization successfully sets the value of the Lazy instance. This would make the middleware more fault-tolerant by enabling implicit retry behavior in subsequent requests. ","C#"

Also the issue around components being registered in certain orders shouldnt be an issue, as groups are inclusive, so if you make an entity and add components <code>A, B, C</code> or <code>B ,C A</code> it doesnt really matter, any systems listening to <code>A,B</code> and <code>B,C</code> would still trigger. The only thing that may be a hiccup for you would be if you wanted the <code>B,C</code> group to be triggered AFTER the <code>A,B</code> had been setup, but this is the reason the predicates exist on groups so you can enforce that you not only want Components but also want some state to be true within the entity.  Currently I do not see any problem with the implementation for events but if you can provide specific problem scenarios (and we can then potentially add them to the unit tests), we can see if changes would be needed but currently I don't think you are safe to just assume components will be loaded in a given order, if you do require an order you can use the predicate. The other point about events not being used/needed cause little overhead and make the system more pluggable.  Anyway have a think and if you get together some examples we can look into it further.

Leaking almost 1.0kb per frame is absolutely unacceptable.  Another problem is: IEnumerableExtensions.RunForEach() - it 'only' allocates 32B but obviously it'll quickly accumulate.  So there are a few separate things here.  Enumerable.ToArray() should be used sparingly and certainly not every frame which is what ReactToGroup is meant for.  Perhaps RunForEach() could be called on accessor.Entities directly?? Since it's effectively just an array converted to another array.  In any case it'll still cause some GC allocation as with the way entities are kept in the groupAccessor it's impossible to convert that foreach loop into a normal for loop.

I use Win7 64 Ultimate German version. English language pack is installed and activated. (Otherwise I wouldn't be able to use Articulate on the desk top.) ArmA3 is stable build, vanilla. Articulate is the installer version.  Problem solved, I think. I normally don't install anyting to my C-drive which I like to reserve for Windows. All the software I need to install goes to E:\Programs. I installed Articulate to E:\Programs\Articulate. Unfortunately this caused my problem. I uninstalled Articulate, ran Glary's Utilities to clean the registry and installed Articulate in the defaut path. This solved the problem and I could use it as intended. I verified this result by deleting and installing again to E:. The problem came back. Articulate crashed when I said the first command.

It also separates the key handling from the UI code, allowing for easier maintenance and fewer merge conflicts as we progress. I've also gone about rewriting much of the handling code to get it as sleek as possible, so maintenance should be a breeze. <h2>Warning</h2> This branch makes changes to the way settings are stored, switching to a binary data format over XML to allow the serialization of complex keycode data. If being able to edit the settings file manually is an important use case then I will look into changing this back (if possible) to allow XML to be used again. <h2>Why I'm Opening a Merge Request</h2> I really think this one needs looking at from a ""where are we going"" point of view. The functionality is great, but it has a rather steep cost in terms of allowing power users the ability to tweak the settings file themselves and encourages complexity over simplicity.  I feel that, if nothing else, this should only be merged once we're ready to implement a separate settings window - as the key-binds list can quickly grow quite large, and doesn't really fit into the UI that well. Ideally I'd like to have that settings flyout behave as a quick tweak page for features a user is likely to access frequently (e.g. confidence margin, if their environment background noise levels require it and possibly Mic gain if we implement it), other less frequently used settings should ideally appear in a new window (working on adding one) which I'd feel happy about cluttering up a bit more with complicated power settings like the command timeout, multiple key-binds etc. ","C#"

"Doxense/foundationdb-dotnet-client","https://github.com/Doxense/foundationdb-dotnet-client","https://github.com/Doxense/foundationdb-dotnet-client/issues/83",NA," If the underlying Directory Layer is modified - behind the back of the application - it is possible that some (or all) subspaces are deleted and re-created but with a different prefix (ex: db wipe + restore). If this happens and the application still use the old cached instance of the subspace, it will read and/or write keys with the OLD prefix, and potentially corrupt other data in the database!  Before solving this (ie: detecting that a directory subspace as changed), we need to be able to create subspaces with a ""revocable"" prefix: the directory layer keeps a reference on the subspaces it has created, and if it detects a change, either update the key prefix (could be dangerous) or poison the instance so that it would throw an exception (preferable, but could nuke the application until it resets).  This is done by splitting <code>IKeySubspace</code> into two parts: IKeyContext that gives access to the prefix, and <code>IKeySubspace</code> itself that deals with key encoding: <ul><li>Make KeySubspace an abstract class</li><li>Add BinaryKeySubspace that inherits the ""binary key"" aspect of a naked KeySubspace</li><li>KeySubspace does not store the prefix but a IKeyContext that can give the prefix</li><li>Add BinaryKeyContext that holds a constant prefix</li></ul> What remains to do is to add other types of key context, for example one for the directory layer that could revoke access to a prefix that is not valid anymore. Once this is done, then we can add the logic in the DL actually do that.  Side effect: it is not possible for subspace to copy the prefix anymore (since we HAVE to be able to revoke it), so this means that exposing the <code>Slice</code> that contains the prefix could be dangerous.

Most of the layers and recipes for FoundationDB were implemented in Python which has rich support of tuples, and also deals with variable size tuples (more like vectors), with appending and truncating tuples one of the core aspect of writing layers.  The various <code>STuple&lt;..&gt;</code> types and <code>ITuple</code> interface were created to bridge the gap in .NET: <ul><li><code>ITuple</code> supports the ""vector"" aspect of things, and deal with size, appending, truncating, and so on.</li><li>All the <code>STuple&lt;T1&gt;</code>, <code>STuple&lt;T1, T2., ...&gt;</code> structs are for all the cases were the tuples are created inline and we can prevent heap allocations with some JIT trickery (using generic methods other structs so that the JIT produces dedicated assembly code) and remove most of the allocations.</li><li><code>ListTuple&lt;..&gt;</code>, <code>SlicedTuple&lt;...&gt;</code>, <code>LinkedTuple&lt;..&gt;</code> each support a specific scenario were vectors are combined, or parsed.</li></ul> Finally, the Tuple Layer would handle encoding and decoding <code>ITuple</code>s into bytes and back.  <strong>The Present</strong>  The BCL as now given us ""real"" tuple support via the <code>System.ValueTuple&lt;...&gt;</code> structs and first-class support at the language level to create, passe around and deconstruct tuples. This make all the existing <code>STuple&lt;...&gt;</code> structs redundant. BUT there is two key differences: <ul><li>ValueTuple&lt;..&gt; are mutable while <code>STuple&lt;..&gt;</code> are immutable. This is not a big deal, but having readonly struct tuples will be nicer with the <code>readonly struct</code> JIT optimizations.</li><li>ValueTuple&lt;...&gt; are fixed-size in nature, and there is not practical way to treat them as vectors: there IS an internal interface <code>ITuple</code> which has the notion of size, but it is not currently exposed, and there is not API to append or truncate vectors.</li></ul> This means that we still need to have our own <code>ITuple</code> to work well with FoundationDB Layers, but can at least take advantage of the literal tuple syntax in C# to remove all the <code>STuple.Create(""foo"", 123)</code> and replace them with nicer <code>(""foo"", 123)</code>.  One way to do this nicely is to add implicit conversions between all the <code>STuple&lt;...&gt;</code> and <code>ValueTuple&lt;..&gt;</code>, as well as add some overloads that directly take ValueTuples as arguments.

If it runs on a Transaction and fails, you have to deal with it. But if it runs on a Database and fails, it may either retry or still blow up in your face.  This means that the <code>@transactional</code> decorator's purpose is to HIDE the behavior of the implementation behind it.  Since this cause a lot of problems (composability, error handling, cancellation, subtile bugs if your lambda execute more than once, ...) the IFdbTransaction interface in the .NET binding DOES NOT implement this interface (changed a long time ago). Currently only IFdbDatabase implements this, and so handlers will always run inside a retry loop;  We would like to turn this interface the other way around, and make it EXPLICIT about the fact that it deals with creating a transaction, and running it inside a retry loop.  For this reason, the name should be changed into <code>IFdbRetryable</code> (and <code>IFdbReadOnlyRetryable</code>) to better match the intent and purpose.  The expected usage of this interface would be to call one of the <code>ReadAsync</code>, <code>ReadWriteAsync()</code> and <code>WriteAsync()</code> overloads, and expecting the handler to execute one or more times.  Since this interface was probably not used much (I guess most people already used <code>IFdbDatabase</code> for arguments), I guess this should not break much code. If it does, the fix is simply to change the name, and maybe take the opportunity to review each call site and decide if it is appropriate or not to ask for a retryable instance. ","C#"

"Doxense/foundationdb-dotnet-client","https://github.com/Doxense/foundationdb-dotnet-client","https://github.com/Doxense/foundationdb-dotnet-client/issues/42",NA," <strong>Tuple API overload resolution ambiguity</strong>  Currently, the Tuple Encoding only supports flat tuples, meaning tuples composed of simple values such as string, integers, GUIDs, and so on. The Tuple API itself allows users to construct Tuples that contain other Tuples, but they will be flattened once packed, and will become flat tuples once unpacked. This issue, combined with some ambiguity in the current API, means that most code out there is relying on an undefined behavior (embedded tuples that get flattened after a roundtrip to the db) and will break in weird ways once the support for embedded tuples is introduced.

For some reason, it chooses to resolve the call to the generic version, instead of the non-generic one. If the variable <code>tuple</code> is declared as an <code>IFdbTuple</code>, then the compiler picks the non-generic version of the Pack method: <div class=""highlight highlight-source-cs""><pre><span class=""pl-en"">IFdbTuple</span> <span class=""pl-smi"">tuple</span> <span class=""pl-k"">=</span> <span class=""pl-smi"">FdbTuple</span>.<span class=""pl-en"">Create</span>&lt;<span class=""pl-k"">int</span>, <span class=""pl-k"">string</span>, <span class=""pl-k"">int</span>&gt;(<span class=""pl-c1"">42</span>, <span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span>abc<span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span>, <span class=""pl-c1"">123</span>);<span class=""pl-en"">Slice</span> <span class=""pl-smi"">key</span> <span class=""pl-k"">=</span> <span class=""pl-smi"">subspace</span>.<span class=""pl-en"">Pack</span>(<span class=""pl-smi"">tuple</span>); <span class=""pl-c""><span class=""pl-c"">//</span> calls the non-generic subspace.Pack(IFdbTuple) method!</span><span class=""pl-smi"">tr</span>.<span class=""pl-en"">Set</span>(<span class=""pl-smi"">key</span>, ....);</pre></div> The main difference is that the non-generic packs the 3-tuple <code>(42, ""abc"", 123)</code> while the generic version creates the singleton <code>( (42, ""abc"", 123), )</code> which contains the original tuple as it single element. But due to the undefined behavior of the Tuple Encoding, it gets flatten before encoding, and both code produce the same result.  With the new support for embedded tuples, the generic version would now produce a different binary key, one that would return the expected singleton tuple when unpacked. This will break any code that was relying on the (undefined) flattening behavior.  Unfortunately, there are not much easy solutions to force the compiler to choose the ""correct"" overload, apart from always returning instances of tuples by their interface. But this would kill the performance benefit of being able to create short lived tuples as structs, which don't need to be garbage collected as long as they stay on the stack.  Only choice currently, is to change the name of all the generic Pack methods, so that there would be no overload resolution ambiguity. And while we are breaking the API, we should take this opportunity to also fix all the other small mistakes that were made.  <strong>Decoupling Subspaces and Tuples</strong>  <strong>Update: the API has changed since this comment. See latest comments for the new version</strong>  The current <code>FdbSubspace</code> class comes from the initial Subspace python prototype (before 2.0) which was promoted into a first class API in FoundationDB 2.0. The main issue with it, is that it does two things at the same time: key subspaces, and key packing using the Tuple Encoding. This makes it very difficult for newcomers to understand what is actually going on (hence why most people fell into the trap of doing <code>subspace.Pack(FdbTuple.Create(1, 2, 3))</code> while they could have used <code>subspace.Pack(1, 2, 3)</code>. This also pollutes the API of classes that uses KeyEncoders, such as <code>FdbEncoderSubspace&lt;T&gt;</code> which wraps a subspace and a custom key encoder (one that use any data encoding format), but it still exposes methods like ""Pack()"" or ""Unpack()"" which are Tuple-only.  The aim of this PR is also to decouple the notion of Tuple Encoding from subspaces, while still allowing people to use them if they don't want to deal with custom encoders.  The proposed solution is to move most key encoding methods from the <code>IFdbSubspace</code> interface (or extension methods), and move them to specific helper structs, that would be connected to the subspace via properties like <code>subspace.Keys</code>, <code>subspaces.Tuples</code>, or subspace.Partition`.  For example, all theses will produce the same key (from less optimized to fastest) <div class=""highlight highlight-source-cs""><pre><span class=""pl-smi"">tr</span>.<span class=""pl-en"">Set</span>(<span class=""pl-smi"">subspace</span>.<span class=""pl-smi"">Partition</span>.<span class=""pl-en"">By</span>(<span class=""pl-c1"">123</span>, <span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span>abc<span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span>).<span class=""pl-smi"">Key</span>, <span class=""pl-smi"">Slice</span>.<span class=""pl-smi"">Empty</span>);<span class=""pl-smi"">tr</span>.<span class=""pl-en"">Set</span>(<span class=""pl-smi"">subspace</span>.<span class=""pl-smi"">Keys</span>[<span class=""pl-smi"">FdbTuple</span>.<span class=""pl-en"">Pack</span>(<span class=""pl-c1"">123</span>, <span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span>abc<span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span>)], <span class=""pl-smi"">Slice</span>.<span class=""pl-smi"">Empty</span>);<span class=""pl-smi"">tr</span>.<span class=""pl-en"">Set</span>(<span class=""pl-smi"">subspace</span>.<span class=""pl-smi"">Tuples</span>.<span class=""pl-en"">Pack</span>(<span class=""pl-smi"">FdbTuple</span>.<span class=""pl-en"">Create</span>(<span class=""pl-c1"">123</span>, <span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span>abc<span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span>)), <span class=""pl-smi"">Slice</span>.<span class=""pl-smi"">Empty</span>);<span class=""pl-smi"">tr</span>.<span class=""pl-en"">Set</span>(<span class=""pl-smi"">subspace</span>.<span class=""pl-smi"">Tuples</span>.<span class=""pl-en"">EncodeKey</span>(<span class=""pl-c1"">123</span>, <span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span>abc<span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span>), <span class=""pl-smi"">Slice</span>.<span class=""pl-smi"">Empty</span>);</pre></div> The <code>subspace.Keys</code> helper struct deals only with binary keys, like Slice, or types that implement <code>IFdbKey</code> and know how to serialize themselves into a binary key. There will be everything needed to add or remove the subspace prefix to keys, deal with many keys at once (optimized), check keys, perform bound checking, etc...  The <code>subspace.Partition</code> helper struct deals with splitting the subspace into smaller subspaces. Since historically it was using the tuple encoding to create the suffixes, this is still supported via any of the <code>subspace.Partition.By&lt;T&gt;</code> overloads.  The <code>subspace.Tuples</code> helper struct deals with tuples. The <code>Pack()</code> and <code>Unpack()</code> methods are non-generic, and deal with tuples as a whole. The <code>EncodeKey&lt;&gt;()</code> and <code>DecodeKey&lt;&gt;()</code> methods deals with items and are faster ways to create keys from tuple (without having to construct the tuple itself in the process). There are also variants that can encode or decode multiple tuples and keys at once.  Most of these helper structs support some shortcuts via indexers, like <code>subspace.Keys[Slice]</code> or subspace.Tuples[IFdbTuple]` which are shorter than calling the actual methods. The indexer method on a subspace itself as been removed, because there was no real good candidate to fill this role, and the current one (returns a new Subspace) was abused into creating sub-partitions just to get there Key, which was the slowest method.  <strong>Parsing and Serializing embedded tuples</strong>  Once the API is in good shape, we can now (without any ambiguity), create keys like <code>(1, (2, 3), ""abc"")</code>, which need to be encoded into bytes, and decoded back into there original shape.  The <code>NewType</code> encoding proposal did provision type headers <code>0x03</code> and <code>0x04</code> for tuple Start and End. Meaning that it would produce the following keys: <ul><li><code>(1, 2)</code> =&gt; <code>&lt;15&gt;&lt;01&gt; &lt;15&gt;&lt;02&gt;</code></li><li><code>( (1, 2), )</code> =&gt; <code>&lt;03&gt; &lt;15&gt;&lt;01&gt; &lt;15&gt;&lt;02&gt; &lt;04&gt;</code></li><li><code>(1, (2, 3, 4), 5)</code> =&gt; <code>&lt;15&gt;&lt;01&gt; &lt;03&gt; &lt;15&gt;&lt;02&gt; &lt;15&gt;&lt;03&gt; &lt;15&gt;&lt;04&gt; &lt;04&gt; &lt;15&gt;&lt;05&gt;</code></li></ul> This has several issues: <ul><li>It uses byte <code>0x04</code> to mark the end of a tuple, which can be found in other tokens, like integer 4 (<code>&lt;15&gt;&lt;04&gt;</code>) or a byte string that would contain 4. This means that the parser cannot just scan until the next <code>0x04</code> to find the end of a tuple. It has to parse the content, to know which <code>0x04</code> are tokens and which are tuple end markers.</li><li>Also, byte <code>0x04</code> (which represents the closing parenthesis) would be sorted <em>after</em> byte[] or string items, as well as embedded tuples. Meaning that <code>(1, (2), ""abc"")</code> would be sorted <em>after</em> <code>(1, (2, ""abc""))</code> but <em>before</em> <code>(1, (2, 42))</code> which is not what one would expect.</li></ul> The only way to solve this issue would be to use <code>0x00</code> as the end marker of a tuple, but it conflicts with the already existing usage of <code>0x00</code> which is to define NIL entries in tuples. So <code>(1, (2, null))</code> and <code>(1, (2,), null)</code> would produce the same result. The proposed solution for ordering issues would be to change the encoding of NILs inside embedded tuples to <code>&lt;00&gt;&lt;FF&gt;</code>, while keeping a single <code>&lt;00&gt;</code> for NILs outside embedded tuples, in order to be compatible with the previous encoding.  The change would then allow things like: <ul><li><code>(1, 2)</code> =&gt; <code>&lt;15&gt;&lt;01&gt; &lt;15&gt;&lt;02&gt;</code></li><li><code>((1, 2), )</code> =&gt; <code>&lt;03&gt; &lt;15&gt;&lt;01&gt; &lt;15&gt;&lt;02&gt; &lt;00&gt;</code></li><li><code>(1, (2, 3, 4), 5)</code> =&gt; <code>&lt;15&gt;&lt;01&gt; &lt;03&gt; &lt;15&gt;&lt;02&gt; &lt;15&gt;&lt;03&gt; &lt;15&gt;&lt;04&gt; &lt;00&gt; &lt;15&gt;&lt;05&gt;</code></li><li><code>(1, (2, null))</code> =&gt; <code>&lt;15&gt;&lt;01&gt; &lt;03&gt; &lt;15&gt;&lt;02&gt; &lt;00&gt;&lt;FF&gt; &lt;00&gt;</code></li><li><code>(1, (2,) null)</code> =&gt; <code>&lt;15&gt;&lt;01&gt; &lt;03&gt; &lt;15&gt;&lt;02&gt; &lt;00&gt; &lt;00&gt;</code></li></ul>","C#"

This can also be an issue if a small query runs while the server is very slow, or if you hit a breakpoint in your code while debugging.  There is no real way to work around this issue, while still having the ACID guarantees of transactions in FoundationDB. The transaction will stop returning new chunks of data after 5 seconds, and resetting the transaction to continue, would break the isolation of the query, which would then see any changes made to the database in the last 5 seconds.  The first possible solution is to create a new type of Transaction that has a different Isolation Level, like proposed here: <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://community.foundationdb.com/content/idea/4146/faking-read-committed-isolation-level-support-for-1.html"">http://community.foundationdb.com/content/idea/4146/faking-read-committed-isolation-level-support-for-1.html</a> . This solution is somewhat easy to do, and would not need any change to the Async LINQ API, apart from passing in a special transaction that lives more than 5 seconds, and accepting the fact that the result of the query will not be isolated from changes to the db. In practice, it would see a new picture of the database every 5 seconds, but still it would require some special care by the caller. Most probably this will not be an issue for most people.  The second possible solution is to support ""resumable"" LINQ queries, meaning that you would run your query with a regular transaction, read as much as you can or want. Then, before or at the 5 seconds time limit, you would ""freeze"" the current state of the query, and get back a token that would be stored somewhere. Then, either immediately, or maybe later (ie: next HTTP request that wants the next page of results), you would create the EXACT SAME query, pass back the token, and the query would ""resume"" from where it left. The token would probably contain the list of keys of all the GetRange(..) that compose the query, and maybe some important inner state of any stateful operators (maybe the Merge operators? maybe SelectAsync?).  I feel that both solution would be useful and needed. <ul><li>The first one would be great for bulk exports or huge aggregations other subspaces of keys that are write-once/read-many. Or any other period task that could miss some keys in the first pass, but would see them anyway on the next pass. Anything that is OK with less than perfect isolation.</li><li>The second one is ideal for web apps that want to display pages of potentially large number of results from a query. Each request reads a chunk of results, and a ""resume token"" so that the next request can continue. Basically emulating a server-side Cursor but where the state is stored client-side.</li></ul>","C#"

The major issue is that this was going unnoticed under the hood when calling <code>FdbTuple.Pack&lt;T&gt;(...)</code> or <code>tuple.Append&lt;T&gt;(..)</code> when <code>T</code> is once of the tuple types.  This means that people calling: <code>FdbTuple.Pack(FdbTuple.Create(123, ""abc""))</code> thought that they were packing the tuple <code>(123, ""abc"")</code> into a key, while in fact they where creating the tuple <code>((123, ""abc""), )</code> into a key. With the existing incorrec behavior, this single tuple that contained a tuple was being flattened, and the bug was transparent. With the new Tuple behavior, this would now produce a completely different key, that would now unpack into a singleton tuple, instead of a tuple of size 2.  The same problem exists with <code>Append&lt;T&gt;</code> where <code>FdbTuple.Empty.Append(FdbTuple.Create(123, ""abc""))</code> would create a singleton <code>((123, ""abc""), )</code> when setting the key, but would unpack into the pair <code>(123, ""abc"")</code> when reading the key back.  The current plan is to redefine the API as following: <ul><li><code>IFdbTuple.Append&lt;T&gt;(T item): IFdbTuple</code> means <em>""create a new tuple with ONE extra item of type T""</em>.<ul><li>Invariant: <code>tuple.Append&lt;T&gt;(item).Count == tuple.Count + 1</code></li></ul></li><li><code>IFdbTuple.Concat(IFdbTuple tuple): IFdbTuple)</code> means <em>""create a new tuple which contains all the items of the current tuple, followed by all the items of the second tuple""</em>.<ul><li>Invariant: <code>t1.Concat(t2).Count == t1.Count + t2.Count</code></li></ul></li><li><code>subspace.Pack&lt;T&gt;(T item) : Slice</code> means <em>""create a key which is the same thing as calling <code>subspace.Key + FdbTuple.Pack&lt;T&gt;(item)</code>""</em>, and where <code>subspace</code> can be anything that wraps the notion of prefix (and in this case the static <code>FdbTuple.Pack&lt;T&gt;(..)</code> represents the empty prefix.<ul><li>Invariant: <code>subspace.Pack&lt;T&gt;(x).Count == subspace.Key.Count + FdbTuple.Pack&lt;T&gt;(x).Count</code></li></ul></li><li><code>subspace.Append&lt;T&gt;(T item) : IFdbTuple</code> means <em>""create a new special tuple that has a single item of type T, and keeps the prefix of subspace once packed""</em>.<ul><li>Invariant: <code>subspace.Append&lt;T&gt;(x).Count == 1</code> and <code>foo.Append&lt;T&gt;(x).ToSlice() == subspace.Key + FdbTuple.Pack&lt;T&gt;(x)</code></li></ul></li></ul> Note that that <code>tuple.Append&lt;T&gt;(x)</code> is a shortcut of calling <code>tuple.Concat(FdbTuple.Create&lt;T&gt;(x))</code> and should mean the same thing.  Once we solve the issue of the Tuple Encoding protocol so that it supports embedded tuples, and preserve the ordering of the keys, we will be able to call one of the many <code>Unpack(..)</code> variants, and get back a tuple with the same shape as the one we put in the database.  Unfortunately, there is a remaining issue, regarding a problem with type inference by the C# compiler, on the <code>FdbTuple.Pack(IFdbTuple)</code> and <code>FdbTuple.Pack&lt;T&gt;(T)</code> methods.  The following code <code>FdbTuple.Pack(FdbTuple.Create(123, ""abc""))</code> will <em>NOT</em> call <code>Pack(IFdbTuple)</code> but instead call <code>Pack&lt;FdbTuple&lt;int, string&gt;&gt;(..)</code> because <code>FdbTuple.Create&lt;int, string&gt;()</code> returns a <code>struct FdbTuple&lt;int, string&gt;</code> instead of the interface <code>IFdbTuple</code> (for memory reasons). Currently, VS 2013 and 2014 both link to the generic override of the method, and there is no way prevent that (no way to add a condition like <code>where T : not(IFdbTuple)</code>.  There is exactly the same issue on the <code>Append(IFdbTuple)</code> vs <code>Append&lt;T&gt;(T)</code> methods, and also on the <code>FdbSubspace</code> class with has the same set of methods.  This means that we HAVE to change the name of one or the other. Preferably in a way that will prevent most people from falling into this trap. ","C#"

Then I make a request to the relevant resource server using that <code>httpClient</code>.  It works for the first access token, and when it expires, it gets a new one successfully. But because the identity provider does not return a new refresh token on a refresh_token grant, the Refresh Token property in the handler does not get updated, (changes to null).  Therefore when that new access token expires again, the call managed by the handler to /oauth/token fails due to the lack of Refresh Token.  Is there a way to reuse the first refresh token obtained within the httpclient handle?

The flow is that when a user tries to login, the OidcClient webview opens up redirecting to Identity Server, where the user can select to login using email address/password or social logins (Eg ; Apple). When logging in through Apple, you can login using Touch ID or apple ID/password. When logging in through apple ID, all is working as expected. User is authenticated in Identity Server, and the app receives the callback and the user can login.  But when using Touch ID to login to Apple, user is still authenticated correctly on the Identity Server side, but the app/Oidc webview doesn't receive a callback. So the webview stays open. I can click the cancel button in the webview and I'll go back to the login screen, where if I click login again, the webview doesn't open up again, I'm just automatically logged into the app.  I have looked at the Xamarin Forms sample to implement Oidc client and have implemented accordingly, the issue still remains.

As far as I know, the only way to do that is with the ""init-wrap"" command. Unfortunately, init-wrap uses the directory name for the package name, so doing something like:  ""ftr_branch_two&gt; o init-wrap -All true -NoSymlinks true -IgnoreFileName .bzrignore""  Results in a new ftr_branch_two.wrapdesc file getting generated. This then causes headaches for MSBuild, etc, etc.  This branch adds a new -PackageName parameter to init-wrap, so we can instead do:  ""ftr_branch_two&gt; o init-wrap -PackageName MyProject -All true -NoSymlinks true -IgnoreFileName .bzrignore""  And it detects the existing MyProject.wrapdesc and behaves as expected.

Based on a quick reading of the analyzer, it appears like this will be done for every <code>await</code>, <code>return</code>, and lambda in the method, meaning that binding and analysis could be done many times over. A quick fix would be to first have the two locations in this analyzer that call <code>GetSemanticModel</code> only get a new semantic model if necessary, but a better fix would be only use the model from the appropriate context, as we've already done binding/analysis and cached the results for these models.  <a target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" href=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2371880/71036477-a6177e80-20d2-11ea-9d1a-8a2a4d7ccbe3.png""><img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2371880/71036477-a6177e80-20d2-11ea-9d1a-8a2a4d7ccbe3.png"" alt=""image"" style=""max-width:100%;""></a> ","C#"

"Microsoft/vs-threading","https://github.com/Microsoft/vs-threading","https://github.com/Microsoft/vs-threading/issues/521","AsyncSemaphore can let too many callers enter when requests are cancelled · """," Thread 1 is canceled while waiting to enter the semaphore, but so soon after it asks for the semaphore that the waitTask is completed by the time we check it (before we yield). Thread 1 is now ""in"" the semaphore but isn't accounted as such. This immediately would let one more thread in concurrently. And when thread 1 exits the semaphore, it will release it, leading to the semaphore allowing 2 threads from then on.  This bug in AsyncSemaphore has been present since its original version (many years ago). But StreamJsonRpc 2.0 was the first version that was vulnerable to it (or at least, the first version that would catch it when it happened and throw an exception). Which could explain failures like this appearing in VS as early as 16.1. We'll get this fixed in vs-threading and patch 16.4 immediately, and 16.3 as soon as we can get it approved. The risk of the fix should be low. Although it is in a very low-level class used in many places, the effect of the change should be very constrained and exactly what we need. <h4>Repro steps</h4> Have a thread trying to enter the semaphore with a CancellationToken that another thread cancels at exactly the same time. The cancellation has to take effect at a very narrow race condition between when <em>we</em> check for cancellation and when the SemaphoreSlim.EnterAsync method checks. <h4>Expected behavior</h4> Cancellation should be handled without allowing the caller to think they entered the semaphore. <h4>Actual behavior</h4> The caller is told they have entered the semaphore. But they haven't, so another thread may be allowed in immediately as well. When the canceled request <em>exits</em> the semaphore, the release the semaphore that they never really entered. This leads to the semaphore's AvailableCount being incremented by one. In a semaphore created with an initialCount of 1, this means that it will become a semaphore with 2 slots. From then on, too many will be allowed in. <ul><li>Version used: 16.3. But this bug impacts all previous versions.</li></ul>","C#"

The issue is that the client subscribes to ""some/topic"" only (no wildcard), but as result also receives ""some/topic/sub"" messages. This is very unlucky if the client uses several subtopics for different tasks...<br>With other brokers (and the same, proven and working MQTT clients), everything works fine.<br>When replacing mosquitto with GnatMQ as the broker (in a running configuration of various clients), the issue has been observed, but you can also reproduce it in an isolated environment (tested on both Win10 IoT Core and Win10 x64).  Steps to reproduce: <ul><li>start ""vanilla"" GnatMQ broker, in either UAP or win32 console application</li><li>using the ""mosquitto_sub"" tool, subscribe to ""some/topic"":<br><code>mosquitto_sub -h 192.168.1.111 -t ""some/topic"" -v</code></li><li>then publish using ""mosquitto_pub"":<br><code>mosquitto_pub -h 192.168..1.111 -t ""some/topic/bla""  -d </code>-l<code> </code>0`</li></ul> expected behavior: message isn't sent to client, since he didnt' subscribe to any wildcard and has no exactly matching subscription.  observed behavior: message is sent to client nevertheless:<br><code>some/topic/bla 0</code>  (also reproducible with M2Mqtt client)  I suspect ""this regex stuff"" in MqttSubscriberManager.cs to be responsible, but have no clue what to do to fix it. When I should test something just let me know.  regards  EDIT:<br>wow I'm learning regex in c# ... :)  I've probably found the cause. I tried the following:<br>` <pre><code>        string string1 = ""some/topic"";        string PLUS_WILDCARD = ""+"";        string SHARP_WILDCARD = ""#"";        string PLUS_WILDCARD_REPLACE = @""[^/]+"";        string SHARP_WILDCARD_REPLACE = @"".*"";        string string2 = string1.Replace(PLUS_WILDCARD, PLUS_WILDCARD_REPLACE).Replace(SHARP_WILDCARD, SHARP_WILDCARD_REPLACE);        Console.WriteLine(""replaced topic: {0}"", string2);        bool result = (new Regex(string2)).IsMatch(""some/topic/bla"");        Console.WriteLine(""Result: {0}"", result.ToString());        bool result2 = (new Regex(""^""+string2+""$"")).IsMatch(""some/topic/bla"");        Console.WriteLine(""Result2: {0}"", result2.ToString());        Console.ReadKey();`</code></pre> `  <strong>Mr Patierno: could you please adjust the regex matching in MqttSUbscriberManager.cs to use exact matching, as shown in above example with ""bool result2""? I think this is a serious bug in GnatMQ.</strong>  In my tests with ^$ around the regex, the wildcard replacement regexes still work as expected (just try with ""string1"" in the example ending in /+ or /# and you'll see) , so I think this is safe to apply this fix without breaking things.

Basically, my Windows7 is KR version, and I play NA tera. So I have to change the language to ""NA"", and the UI lang to ""en-US"" in order for the meter to work correctly in NA tera.  After start my computer, the first meter running works perfectly as it used to be. However, if I close the meter and run it again, the UI language will be changed to my default languae (Korean) even though the windows.xml file still has ""en-US"" for UI language. And when I closed the meter, I get ""An fetal error has be found, please see the error.log file for more information"". This issue keeps happening for the after the 1st meter (that I run after booting my computer) is closed. And the only solution for now is that I have to restart my computer, and then the 1st meter will be working perfectly again.  Could you help me with this issue? ","C#"

But there has been always something I was missing: An instantaneous dps. Shinra Meter is only showing you an average dps over the whole fight. So - also you wouldn't do this - if you have something like a brake while you are still in a fight (e.g. kiting the boss), you loose dps for doing nothing. But you can't tell afterwards if you was better or worse than another fight without a brake.  This is when instantaneous dps comes in play. It does not look for the whole fight, but for a short time period or to be exactly for a specific point in time. So you can still see if you are doing well or not. Of course there is a disadvantage comparing with the average dps. The average dps is just one value. Instantaneous dps would be several values over the whole fight. To be exactly, it is the derivation of the function that discribes the damage done for a specific time. Because I think you are just using simple calculation, it might be difficult to realize.  So to simplify it, you could just take the dps over a short time interval. The interval can be variable. E.g. starting from 2s to a maximum of 10s. Let's say the we set the value to 2s. The pseudo instantaneous dps would show the dps for the last 2s.<br>Instantaneous dps or the pseudo instantaneous dps would als help tanks to see, when they are about to loose aggro and react before it happens.<br>And you could also draw it in a graph to show when dps was well or worse.

Attempting to alter OT Affection ins SwSh doesn't work at all , just resets to 0, I'm assuming this is intended though.  Gen 3 (LeafGreen) Bred Arcanine should be able to know Morning Sun via the new Egg Move mechanic in the day care between Pokemon of the same species in SwSh.

I think this would be useful for Pokémon that you might not know the evolution to forcing you to look up the name. I think this would also fix the problems that people are having with trade evolutions as well because you could set the handler to pkhex or whatever needed.

Dragon Rage is not an egg move (Charmeleon learns it at level 48, which this one is below), but upon removing Dragon Rage, the Charmeleon is considered legal.  <strong>To Reproduce</strong><br>Here is the Charmander family in question:<br><a href=""https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX/files/4143167/Save.Files.zip"">Save Files.zip</a>  They are all based on the same Charmander, except the Charmeleon has Dragon Rage which is not yet possible at its level. Giving and removing Dragon Rage will give the confusing report.  <strong>Expected behavior</strong><br>1: The report should not believe the Charmeleon came from an egg because Dragon Rage is not an egg move for this family in generation 3.<br>2: In the case of having egg moves on a starter, the type mismatch is correct. However, it should be more clear that it is illegal because of the move in question. For example, my Bulbasaur family has the same report on the Venusaur because the Venusaur has Magical Leaf which is an egg move. I would not have guessed to look in the moves from this report. ","C#"

My main concern at that time was the machinations necessary to set options based on other services – the whole <code>IConfigureOptions&lt;TOptions&gt;</code> rigmarole feels at best second class. We’re hoping you can find a germ in this worth adding sooner or later. That is, please run with something.  I wrote up the <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://gist.github.com/dougbu/bc4880f0aadce9d94b7df91d53782da0"">https://gist.github.com/dougbu/bc4880f0aadce9d94b7df91d53782da0</a> gist based on these discussions. The basic thing is semi-automatic discovery of <code>Startup</code> methods that configure options. These methods are all named <code>ConfigureOptions</code>, take a first parameter of the <code>TOptions</code> they set, and may have additional parameters grabbed from DI.  David and I covered a few questions but didn’t completely resolve them: <ul><li>Should the <code>ConfigureOptions</code> methods always be found and executed? Or, must the user call <code>services.Configure&lt;TOptions&gt;()</code> for every <code>TOptions</code> or perhaps a less-granular <code>services.ConfigureOptions()</code>?</li><li>Must <code>ConfigureOptions</code> methods be within <code>Startup</code>? For example, the explicit configuration request might be <code>services.ConfigureOptions(this)</code> if you do want to use the <code>Startup</code> class.</li><li>When are the <code>ConfigureOptions</code> methods executed and in what relative order? Granular <code>services.Configure&lt;TOptions&gt;()</code> methods might be semantically identical to placing an <code>IConfigureOptions&lt;TOptions&gt;</code> implementation into DI at that time. If supported, we’d need to decide if <code>services.ConfigureOptions()</code> called the methods in whatever order Reflection returns, alphabetically by <code>TOptions</code> name, or something else. And if <code>UseStartup&lt;Startup&gt;</code> implies <code>ConfigureOptions()</code> discovery, are the methods executed before or after <code>IConfigureOptions&lt;TOptions&gt;</code> implementations that <code>ConfigureServices()</code> adds?</li></ul> About all we resolved is that what we have now isn’t great and <code>Startup: IConfigureOptions&lt;MvcOptions&gt;, IConfigureOptions&lt;RazorViewEngineOptions&gt;</code> wouldn’t help with service resolution (besides being butt-ugly).

The dependency could be broken by splitting the parts of options that depend from configuration (e.g. <code>serviceCollection.Configure(configuration) and its implementation class</code>ConfigureFromConfigurationOptions`) into their own package.  Optionally, moving that package in its own repo would help breakup the chain of build dependencies for our CI. ","C#"

Consumers can DI the <code>IReloadableOptions&lt;T&gt;</code> and see updates according to three supported patterns:  1.) Get the current value when the component was created (useful for scoped and transient business objects who don't want<br>to deal with concurrency issues). <pre><code>public class HomeController{    private AppSettings _settings;    public HomeController(IReloadableOptions&lt;AppSettings&gt; options)    {        _settings = options.Value;    }    private bool PriceOfGas =&gt; _settings.PriceOfGas;}</code></pre> This differs from the normal <code>IOptions&lt;T&gt;</code> behavior. <code>Value</code> can change after it is first accessed.  2.) Get the current value each time <code>.Value</code> is called. Useful when you want realtime updates, but don't have a complicated<br>set of concurrency behaviors to deal with. <pre><code>public class HomeController{    private IReloadableOptions&lt;AppSettings&gt; _options;    public HomeController(IReloadableOptions&lt;AppSettings&gt; options)    {        _options = options;    }    private bool PriceOfGas =&gt; _options.Value.PriceOfGas;}</code></pre> 3.) Be notified when the value changes. Useful for long-lived components that was to recompute data when options change. <pre><code>public class ProductPriceService : IDisposable{    private AppSettings _settings;    private IDisposable _subscription;    public ProductPriceService(IReloadableOptions&lt;AppSettings&gt; options)    {        _subscription = options.Subscribe(s =&gt; _settings = s);    }    private bool PriceOfGas =&gt; _settings.PriceOfGas;    public void Dispose()    {        _subscription?.Dispose();    }}</code></pre> When using this pattern you <strong>WILL LEAK</strong> if you don't unregister your callback. The callback is called <strong>immediately</strong> and<br>the surrounding object needs to be prepared to deal with that case. ","C#"

This means I can update the config values directly in the database table. This question isn't specific to EF though, but more generally about providers that allow their values to be modified at runtime.  My question is, how can I make this provider support <code>IOptionsSnapshot</code> mechanism - i.e so that after values are changed in the source (EF table in this case), the existing snapshots can be flagged as outdated so that new snapshots are obtained next time a request is made through DI.  I am not asking about how to detect changes made in the table itself. Let's assume that my EF provider offers up an <code>Update&lt;TOptions&gt;(TOptions options)</code> method that it will be used to update the values in underlying table for a particular options class when we wish to modify them. In this instance, after the table has been updated, the provider knows exactly which <code>TOptions</code> class has had its values changed and so now it needs to make sure new snapshots are created - how does it do that?

If the current time is outside of that range, the subreddit is excluded from the selection of subreddits from which wallpapers can be pulled. Entries with malformed time codes are skipped.  To facilitate this, a new parse function has been added. In addition, the changeWallpaper function now quietly returns if no subreddits are available.  An example use case for this might be choosing motivational subreddits in the morning and relaxing subreddits at night.

Installing into Program FIles would require RWC to run with administrator privileges though, as Logs and the Blacklist are written into the folder that contains the executable.  To fix this, I made some changes so that the program will now write to an AppData folder. In the progress, I threw out the XML class and created a new Blacklist class to remove some redundant code in RWC.cs (for example in the Blacklist() and MenuBlacklist() methods). The new class also removes the need for RWC.cs to point to the Blacklist.xml specifically more than once (when setting it up).<br>Logs are also written into the AppData folder.  I have not created a Favourites class yet, but doing so should be very little work, if you decide to activate that feature at any point in the future. I am wondering whether it would make sense to create an XML class and have Blacklist and Favourites inherit from that class?  I also moved the default file for saving the wallpapers to a subfolder of My Pictures.  Attention: I removed the method for deleting the dummy, since I could not figure out what it is needed for. Is it for something when first installing the program? If so, I'll be happy to reimplement it (or I am sure you will figure it out much more quickly than I would).<br>Also, in RWC.cs: <pre><code>List&lt;string&gt; historyList = new List&lt;string&gt;();            foreach (DataGridViewRow item in historyDataGrid.Rows)            {                if (item.Cells[4].Value != null)                {                    list.Add(item.Cells[4].Value.ToString());                }            }</code></pre> I'm not entirely sure, but I think it has to be <code>historyList.Add(item.Cells[4].Value.ToString());</code>, right? If that is wrong, make sure not to accept that change!  My changes held up to all tests I could think of, I hope I did not break anything. I haven't changed anything to the installation wizard (since I do not know how), so if you want to incorporate some of my changes, you'd have to do that yourself. ","C#"
"Rawns/Reddit-Wallpaper-Changer","https://github.com/Rawns/Reddit-Wallpaper-Changer","https://github.com/Rawns/Reddit-Wallpaper-Changer/issues/14",NA," I kept having the problem that the imgur placeholer for deleted images was being selected as background (<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://i.imgur.com/removed.png"">http://i.imgur.com/removed.png</a>).<br>Not a big issue, but annoying sometimes.  I figured out that when following a link for a deleted image (for example <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://i.imgur.com/Xz08Z.jpg"">http://i.imgur.com/Xz08Z.jpg</a>) you get an HTML status code 302 (Found) &amp; a redirect to the removed.png linked above. When following a link for an image that has not been deleted, you get status code 200 (OK).  With the small addition to RWC.cs, RWC will check the status code when using an Imgur Link, and search for another wallpaper, hopefully finding one that has not been deleted.  Note that I also increase the counter for unsuccessfultries. This is to prevent RWC running into an infinite loop on subreddits with a large number of deleted images. However, I have noticed that you do not do this in setWallpaper(), so just a heads up for that.  Feel free to use it or delete it.<br>Let me know if you are open to receive other pull requests in the future.<br>As said on the subreddit, I'd love to help out with this project a little, but lack the time and experience to create my own fork.

This is to verify that we can perform a  rolling restart (<a rel=""nofollow"" href=""http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/recovery/rolling-restart/"">http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/ops/running/recovery/rolling-restart/</a>) without losing any data.<br>We did this in two ways: <ol><li>Running the <code>riak stop</code> command, as is mentioned in the rolling restart docs, to simulate a graceful shutdown</li><li>Killing the beam process with the <code>kill</code> command to simulate a crash</li></ol> Surprisingly, in the first scenario, shortly after a node was stopped we saw a handful of client failures with the socket error: <code>CommunicationError: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it.</code> From looking at the Riak .NET client code it appears to me that the only way that this type of error could be returned would be if all retry attempts failed. The confusing part to me is that the client code has logic to remove the node from the list of available nodes before the next retry if the exception has set the <code>NodeOffline</code> property to true. Is the client code somehow getting <code>RiakExceptions</code> where <code>NodeOffline</code> is set to false while the node is being stopped with the ‘riak stop’ command?  In the second scenario where we just kill the process, we don’t see any of these <code>CommunicationErrors</code>. ","C#"

For example, assuming <code>MyProp</code> is a content picker, you can do the following: <pre><code>@Model.MyProp.GetValue(""es"", fallbackCultureName: ""en"").Name</code></pre> Things to note are, that using the <code>GetValue</code> methods on the Models Builder property doesn't allow recursive properties. Given this is pretty much true throughout Models Builder though, I don't see that as a problem. And you can always revert back to the old approach which will still work.  What do people think of the syntax? Is there a better approach we could follow?  Also, due to this update, there has been a huge change in how the value converter works. Where we previously converted property values on the fly, we now convert all the values in the value converter and then in the extension methods we are just doing lookups.

This won’t allow me to reuse it across multiple incoming requests (which is fine) but at least I can reuse it within my request scope for multiple outgoing requests. That will also save me against the third problem. But storing the handler just makes the second problem even more problematic since I now don’t even have some point in time where I could dispose of the object. <hr> So what I would like to ask for is some means for reusing the handler. The primary problem that makes the instance difficult to reuse (for different users) is that the tokens are private instance state. Ideally, I would want to write something like this that moves the tokens completely out of the instance: <pre><code>public class UserRefreshTokenDelegatingHandler : RefreshTokenDelegatingHandler{    private readonly IHttpContextAccessor _httpContextAccessor;    public override string AccessToken    {        get        {            if (_httpContextAccessor.HttpContext.Items.TryGetValue(""_AccessToken"", out var token))                return (string)token;            return null;        }        set        {            _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext.Items[""_AccessToken""] = value;        }    }    public override string RefreshToken        =&gt; _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext.User.GetRefreshToken();    public UserRefreshTokenDelegatingHandler(TokenClient tokenClient, IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor)        : base(tokenClient)    {        _httpContextAccessor = httpContextAccessor;    }}</code></pre> Obviously, that doesn’t work right now, so I am wondering what you would think about this idea. Whether it would be something worth to invest in, or whether you have alternative ideas. I’m currently considering just implementing everything myself by copying most of the existing logic, but I would much rather reuse the existing logic, and instead contribute to the upstream <code>RefreshTokenDelegatingHandler</code> to make it reusable.

The applications are both older WinForms client/server and web clients as SPA apps. The final goal is to provide a user friendly SSO-implementation for our users that might use any combination of above products on their pc. Note that we also have scheduled services that need to login using username/pwd.  By looking at the different parts of IdentityModel it seems like you have most parts covered, although we are quite unfamiliar with using oidc, oauth and ADFS-based security. So although this is really a question for advice and not an issue with the libraries, I hope that you can give me a short answer.  My understanding of IdentityModel given our needs are that we should: <ul><li>Use oidc-client-js for the SPA apps. I have implemented this and it seems to work well.</li><li>Use the .net standard helper library to manage silent logins using user/pwd for our scheduled services that run without user interaction.</li></ul> My main concern is what to use for the WinForms-clients. From what I can see, the helper library (IdentityModel package) doesn't support UI-interaction with the login page? So for these clients I guess that Oidc-Client2-package is the way to go with the implementation resembling that in the WinForms example?  Finally, what is the best way to support SSO using the IdentityModel packages? How to share the tokens between the different types of applications?  Hope that you can give med some advice and perhaps there are other users that can share their thoughts of how they have solved similar architectural challenges. ","C#"

What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?WinXP, Obfuscar 1.0.0.0Please provide any additional information below.It would be a nice feature to add to obfuscar if you could reverse a call stack trace into original type and method names. You'd parse the call stack text based on its default format and perform lookups for all type and method names found. If you find it, you replace it, if not, you just leave the original call description intact.</code></pre> Original issue reported on code.google.com by <code>obiwanja...@hotmail.com</code> on 8 May 2007 at 6:20 ","C#"

Its seems to be related to 8bit encoding, because when message is send though Thunderbird, <code>content-transfer-encoding</code> is set to 8bit (mails send from all other mail client are using different type than 8bit- mainly quoted-printable -  and in this case are signed properly).  I am start to thinking (after read many posts about exchange/dkim and 8bitmime encoding issues) that problem is in exchange re-encoding, but weird is that I also tested trial of EA DomainKeys/DKIM and it works properly with same Exchange configuration and thunderbird / 8bit encoding (i.e. same exchange config, same client, same mail content but one time is Exchange DkimSigner enabled and second time is EA DomainKeys agend enabled..) Now i am wondering if I miss some special setting needed for DkimSigner or it can be issue of dkimsigner itself.  Has anyone similar issue?  Used last version of DkimSigner v.2.1.4 (RsaSha1, Relaxed/Relaxed - but I tried also other combinations), Exchange 2007 (8.3.83.6).  I can provide any log or message header if needed.

"aspnet/Mvc","https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc","https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/7876","Internal routing prevents using route parameter names “page”, “action”, and “controller” · """," For example, <a href=""https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/blob/2.1.0/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core/UrlHelperExtensions.cs#L447-L458"">this code</a> basically prevents us from using a <code>page</code> route value when using Razor pages: <pre><code>if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(pageName)){    if (!routeValues.ContainsKey(""page"") &amp;&amp;        ambientValues.TryGetValue(""page"", out var value))    {        routeValues[""page""] = value;    }}else{    routeValues[""page""] = CalculatePageName(urlHelper.ActionContext, pageName);}</code></pre> So basically, when there’s no explicit <code>pageName</code> set (e.g. using <code>asp-page</code> in the tag helper), then it will pick up the value from the <code>page</code> route value (e.g. using <code>asp-route-page</code>). That’s fine on its own but ultimately, the <code>page</code> route value will be overwritten with the resulting page name.  Similar logic also exists for the <a href=""https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/blob/2.1.0/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core/Routing/UrlHelper.cs#L70-L82"">MVC side of it</a>, e.g. for the <code>action</code> and <code>controller</code> route value.  To make it clear what this means, the following action in a controller will always have the <code>controller</code> and <code>action</code> value set to a constant value: <pre><code>public IActionResult Test(string controller, string action){ … }</code></pre> At some point, there was some effort to make sure that the addition of Razor pages wouldn’t break the usage of a <code>page</code> parameter in MVC. This was done in <a class=""commit-link"" data-hovercard-type=""commit"" data-hovercard-url=""https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/commit/9f5e4eb483e19be069defa6b091aebef166d50be/hovercard"" href=""https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/commit/9f5e4eb483e19be069defa6b091aebef166d50be""><tt>9f5e4eb</tt></a>.  I understand that this was done to make the whole system more flexible, so instead of transferring the data separately (which would have made adding Razor pages more difficult), it is stored within the route values. But what I am wondering is why those names were chosen for this internal routing data.  Especially the names <code>action</code> and <code>page</code> are super common in routes, and are also incidentally the easiest to break here. Couldn’t some more internal names have been used here instead? E.g. <code>asp-action</code> and <code>asp-page</code>, or something else? Is there any chance we could still change this now? (I assume setting actions using <code>asp-route-action</code> is a supported thing to do? <g-emoji class=""g-emoji"" alias=""confused"" fallback-src=""https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f615.png"">😕</g-emoji>)  cc <a class=""user-mention"" data-hovercard-type=""user"" data-hovercard-url=""/users/DamianEdwards/hovercard"" data-octo-click=""hovercard-link-click"" data-octo-dimensions=""link_type:self"" href=""https://github.com/DamianEdwards"">@DamianEdwards</a>, <a class=""user-mention"" data-hovercard-type=""user"" data-hovercard-url=""/users/pranavkm/hovercard"" data-octo-click=""hovercard-link-click"" data-octo-dimensions=""link_type:self"" href=""https://github.com/pranavkm"">@pranavkm</a>, <a class=""user-mention"" data-hovercard-type=""user"" data-hovercard-url=""/users/Bartmax/hovercard"" data-octo-click=""hovercard-link-click"" data-octo-dimensions=""link_type:self"" href=""https://github.com/Bartmax"">@Bartmax</a> ","C#"

The previous version was perfectly executed, creating an empty object of the viewmodel used in the view (in this case ArchivoViewModel), but in the new version it tries to use the viewmodel of the first call (in this case List ) causing the exception:  <code>InvalidOperationException: The model item passed into the ViewDataDictionary </code>  In this case, this is solved with<br><code>else if (ViewComponentContext.Arguments.TryGetValue(""vista"", out vista)) { return View((string)vista, new ArchivoViewModel()); }</code>  But there are other cases in which it is more difficult to solve, is this change of normal operation? I find nothing about it.  I hope I explained well  Thanks. ","C#"

By saying code commentary I mean small description of an attribute placed at the top of the class in between the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> tags.  For <code>HttpMethodAttribute</code> it states: <blockquote> <em>Identifies an action that only supports a given set of HTTP methods.</em> </blockquote> ...and for <code>HttpGetAttribute</code>, for example: <blockquote> <em>Identifies an action that only supports the HTTP GET method.</em> </blockquote> I am no natively speaking English man, but for me that <em>""only""</em> is suggesting that controller action annotated with such attribute is bound to support only specific type of HTTP method/s, which is untrue since <code>HttpMethodAttribute</code> allows using multiple attributes on the same member, as defined in <code>AttributeUsage</code> in <a href=""https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/blob/release/2.2/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core/Routing/HttpMethodAttribute.cs#L12"">source file</a>.

Both are working. <code>Index()</code> method supports both <code>HTTP GET</code> and <code>HTTP POST</code> requests. If my way of understanding of code commentary is correct, then such behaviour is conflicting to what the code commentary is saying.  Take note that I am aware, that code written in such manner violates some good practises how to construct web applications or APIs but here it does not matter. Why? Because if no compile-time error is stopping me from writing such code, then code commentary should include such scenario. <h4>Suggested solution to the problem</h4> Remove the <em>""only""</em> word from in-code commentary description of <code>HttpMethodAttribute</code> class and derived ones. <h4>Version of <code>Microsoft.AspNetCore.All</code>:</h4> 2.1.4 ","C#"

"aspnet/Mvc","https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc","https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/8307","Support for passive streaming of results instead of active writing by IActionResultExecutor · """," Feature request <h4>Description of the problem:</h4> In the old ASP.net Web API the <code>IHttpActionResults</code> were baked by the classical <code>HttpResponseMessage</code> and <code>HttpContent</code>. The <code>HttpContent</code> provides the nice <code>ReadAsStreamAsync()</code> which allows the service stack (server) to decide how this data packed and submitted further.  In ASP.net core and driven by OWIN this communication direction was inverted. The <code>IServer</code> needs to provide already a response <code>Stream</code> (owin.ResponseBody) where the <code>IActionResultExecutor</code> directly will write to via <code>context.Response.Body</code>.  This works fine for most of the server implementations provided by the ASP.net infrastructure. But not all communication systems have a raw stream where you can directly write to. The data might need to be packed into an additional data frame. In the old ASP.net Web API you simply passed on the stream for the body to the component which was then encoding header and body appropriatly.  ASP.net core should also provide a way that ActionExecutors do not directly write the whole body into a result stream but rather set a result-stream object like in the old ASP.net WebApi. (see proposal below)  For most results it is no problem to buffer the whole result in-memory before transmitting it. But especially the File- and Stream results should provide the raw stream to read from to the server or middleware. <h5>Concrete usecase</h5> We have the strict security requirement that the ASP.net Web API is running in the LAN, not accessible via internet. This way the service has access to internal databases and other servers/services. The OData based API should then be exposed via a reverse proxy / relay running in the DMZ.  Our classical solution for this is to have a WCF Duplex channel where we connect from the LAN to the DMZ service. The DMZ service accepts the HTTP requests, and tunnels the request through the duplex channel to the backend service. There I start the Web API using a custom IServer implementation. Whenever a request is incoming via WCF I forward it to the Web API via OWIN.  And here you can clearly see the issue. If you have a <code>FileStreamResult</code> or <code>ObjectResult</code> which is executed as part of the request, it will directly set the headers and write the whole body data into the body stream. But from a WCF perspective you do not have a stream you can directly write to.  Once the whole request is completed, you pass on the result object to WCF to sent it as reply.  In my case it is a WCF channel where the result object needs to be sent to but other servers could require: <ul><li>A service bus for dispatching the results</li><li>A websocket based channel (HTTP over WebSocket tunnel)</li></ul><h5>Implementation Idea</h5> ASP.net core (Web API) could define and implement a OWIN extension that allows passing a HTTP body stream from the application to the OWIN environment.

This is really just an if statement and I see no reason to hide it inside a tag. I'm afraid tag helpers could be overused just because they're new and look nice (if you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail). I hope there is some thought put into decisions about making these before non-html-related tag helpers are introduced as part of the product. To me, these experiments seem a little short-sighted.  A good example is the environment tag helper that was introduced from the very beginning: <div class=""highlight highlight-text-html-basic""><pre>&lt;<span class=""pl-ent"">environment</span> <span class=""pl-e"">names</span>=<span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span>Development<span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span>&gt;&lt;/<span class=""pl-ent"">environment</span>&gt;&lt;<span class=""pl-ent"">environment</span> <span class=""pl-e"">names</span>=<span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span>Staging,Production<span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span>&gt;&lt;/<span class=""pl-ent"">environment</span>&gt;</pre></div> This seemed fine as a replacement for an if-statement but it was lacking one major feature - an else clause. As a result, it was later modified to support include/exclude but I feel like the underlying problem here is that we're trying to replace C# with tags.  I'm happy to have tag helpers for actual tags or html generation like validation, as a replacement for DisplayFor or even for including a partial view - after all partial views are just another big chunk of other html that gets generated. But tag helpers just aren't suited for things like conditional or any kind of logic.  What I really hope for is that there won't ever be something like a for-loop tag helper in the future. I'm sure such a thing could even work for most cases but never for all of them, only leading to inconsistencies. Please don't blindly start using tag helpers for everything until we later realize that they can't actually be used for everything. There will always be need to use C# for certain logic - and Razor syntax already makes that really convenient. Let C# do what it's best at and let's use tag helpers for what they are good at - simplifying HTML. In my view, all tag helpers should be declarative and never used as a replacement for imperative code.  After all, is there ever going to be asp-else or asp-switch? What about asp-else-if? Probably not. Even if a foreach tag helper could be made to work, this is not the only useful loop in C#. What if you want indexes? Is there going to be asp-foreach &amp; asp-for &amp; asp-do-while? I really hope we don't just start stealing features from C#. ","C#"

"aspnet/Mvc","https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc","https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/4245","Potential clarity problems with IUrlHelper · ""","<h5>IUrlHelper</h5> Why is <code>IUrlHelper</code> not called something like <code>IUriProvider</code> when it can return not only urls but also absolute paths (=uri). Many people mix the terms uri and url but usually url is a subset of uri and means absolute uris.<br>Also there is the <code>UriHelper</code> class in the <code>HttpAbstractions</code> namespace. The way to distinguish between those two would be based on a false premise of <code>IUrlHelper</code>. The existing <code>UriHelper</code> only has extension methods, so the class name won’t be used that often but this might still cause some confusion. <h5>IUrlHelper ""main"" methods</h5> There is <code>IUrlHelper.Action</code> vs <code>IUrlHelper.RouteUrl</code>. Both generate uris as I understand it. Only one has an Url suffix. <h5>IUrlHelper.Link</h5> I find this method very confusing. It sounds like now all of a sudden html a-tags come into play. I thought we are dealing with addresses here. Then reading the comment I see that it generates an absolute uri. Ah ok, wouldn’t that be a fit for <code>UrlHelperExtensions</code> then? Wait there is already <pre><code>string RouteUrl(this IUrlHelper helper, string routeName, object values)</code></pre> vs. <pre><code>string Link(string routeName, object values);</code></pre> Which one do I use? <h5>IUrlHelper.IsLocalUrl</h5> When reading the method name I think: ""OK, I can pass any uri (because otherwhere the term url is also used for uris) and then I know if that uri points to a resource of my web app (may this resource really exist or not). After a quick glance at the implementation I thought that maybe this method is mixing up internal vs outgoing uris and absolute vs relative uris. But it turns out it doesn't deal with urls (in the correct sense) at all. Other methods of the type seem to understand the concept of hosting context. For instance I can get me an url when I don't provide the host: <pre><code>Url.Action(""MyAction"", ""My"", null, ""http"");</code></pre> gives <code>http://localhost:1507/my/myaction</code>  Now <code>IsLocalUrl</code> is completely different. It only checks if the provided string is an absolute path. What makes matters even worse it considers both <code>/</code> and <code>~/</code> as local. So now all of a sudden virtual paths come into play (since ~ shouldn't occur in real addresses)? The method is called <code>IsLocalUrl</code>but deals with absolute (possibly virtual) paths. The method cannot say at all if an url is ""local"" or not. Why even throw in a method that is so different. The other methods are about providing uris based on mvc concepts like controllers + actions or routes. Why is a method that has no knowledge of the hosting context in a service type. Why do I need a service for this static functionality? <h5>UrlHelperExtensions xml docs</h5> All methods have the comment „Generates a fully qualified or absolute URL“. Whether it’s an absolute path or an url depends on the overload. The comment is only true for the <code>IUrlHelper</code> interface. <h4>HttpAbstractions</h4> I also opened a somewhat related <a href=""https://github.com/aspnet/HttpAbstractions/issues/573"" data-hovercard-type=""issue"" data-hovercard-url=""/aspnet/HttpAbstractions/issues/573/hovercard"">issue</a> for <code>UriHelper</code> which I find even more confusing.

When your <code>EventSource</code> subclass type is registered as an event provider with ETW at runtime, it is assigned not only its 'friendly display name' (e.g., the name of the class itself or optionally the value in the <code>[EventSource(""your-name-here"")]</code> attribute applied to the subclass), but also an underlying GUID that uniquely identifies it as a provider to ETW.  The cause of this error seems to be that each <em>instance</em> of the <code>EventSource</code> subclass tries to register itself with the ETW subsystem as its used to pass log input to ETW.  Because all instances of the <code>EventSource</code> subclass share the <em>same</em> 'friendly name' and GUID, this results in the above error message being generated from the ETW subsystem (since each event provider can be registered with ETW only once). <h3>Analysis</h3> From the discussion in the two issues/comments linked above, there appears to be some significant uncertainty as to whether this ERROR condition results in lost log entries or whether it is merely 'noise' in the ETW subsystem that is safe to ignore.  In my own cursory testing, I have observed that the ERROR condition prevents subsequent logs from Common.Logging from appearing in ETW when ETW is viewed in Visual Studio via the <em>View &gt; Other Windows &gt; Diagnostics Events</em> window.  However, when those same events are viewed via PerfView.exe, the ERROR condition is reported but so too are all subsequent log inputs to ETW from Common.Logging.  This seems to bolster the confusion/disagreement from those two referenced threads as to whether this is really an ERROR state that ""matters"". <h3>Recommendation</h3> Experiment with refactoring <code>ETWLoggerFactoryAdapter</code> and/or <code>ETWLogger</code> to provide at least <em>some</em> 'safe path' to using ETW with Common.Logging that would support avoiding this 'duplicate registration' error case.  While it may be impossible to prevent <em>all</em> possible usage patterns of ETW support in Common.Logging from producing this error condition, in the current implementation there aren't <em>any</em> usable patterns that would permit adopters to avoid it.  Since its at least possible that this error condition results in lost log data, at least <em>one</em> usage pattern for ETW under Common.Logging needs to be offered before ETW support can be considered 'production-ready' for GA.

Just looking at the browser flags shows where this is the case.  Often, there is a JavaScript-based workaround available for the action which the web driver would otherwise perform. One such workaround is currently in use for setting date values (some browsers need to set it directly via script).  This workaround currently only works for an element selected by ID. However JavaScript has come some way and native selection by CSS selector is also possible. <h2>This ticket</h2> This ticket is to look into the feasibility of expanding upon that 'JavaScript workaround' concept into some kind of service which can provide workarounds to-order. The outcome would be a feasibility assessment as well as a rough architectural plan to implement it. <h2>Notes so far</h2> Workarounds are expected to be based upon: <ul><li>Workaround name<ul><li>Each workaround would have a name by which it is registered</li><li>Those names would actually be related to a concrete type which provides that workaround, so actually it wouldn't use a string name, but rather a type name</li></ul></li><li>Web element adapter (target element)</li><li>Browse the web ability (web driver)</li></ul> Indeed, the signature of a workaround may well be very similar to the signature of a performable. It might be that I can use the base performable interfaces as the base type for these.  What I expect is a factory which creates the workaround instances, assembling JavaScript from a number of snippets stored in the application. This would return an instance of a type which executes that workaround on the browser. ","C#"

Since I don't get any response on the Plugin specific Github I'll try asking here. I already adapted it so it doesnt fail to generate the whole documentation when plantUml fails to generate a diagramm(basicly just some try catch with Logger Output) and some other irrelevant additions. PlantUml already supports Links but I would need to give it the resulting link to the path of the Uid or somehow adapt the Link of the output SVG afterwards. So I would like to know how I could do this since I dont find a way myself. Also where can I find the destination of the md-file I'm rendering? token.SourceInfo.File gives me a part of it(relative path from docfx.json) and token.SourceInfo.File.FormatPath(System.UriKind.Absolute) gives me the workdestination of my console and it just appends the relative path of the markdown even though that folder does not exist. I cant find a attribute where the destination of docfx.json is given so I could get the resulting path that way. Thank you. ","C#"

"dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet","https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet","https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1325","Surface native code size benchmarked code · """," Currently, there is not enough attention given to this metric and to its importance in evaluating performance of a given benchmark/alternative. To be more exact, this metric is non-existent when it comes to BDN and most other benchmark harnesses (native and JIT'd).  While I, personally, have been aware of this for a long time to some extent, I was still shocked while reading about Google's own <a href=""https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/e52f61fd2c51e8962305120548581efacbc06ffc.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">AsmDB</a> from various glorious optimization failures that were shown there.  Section (4) of that paper really provides a wake-up call to all the ""optimize at all cost"" crowd (present company included, unfortunately) as to the system and fleet wide implications of ignoring code-bloat. Sub-section 4.4, specifically tells the horror story of over-optimizing <code>memcmp()</code>, which I'll reprint here for context: <blockquote> memcmp clearly stands out of the correlation between call frequency and function size in Figure 8. It is both extremely frequent, and, at almost 6 KiB of code, 10× larger than memcpy which is<br>conceptually of similar complexity. Examining its layout and execution patterns (Figure 13) suggests that it does suffer from the high amount of fragmentation we observed fleetwide in the previous section.<br>While covering 90% of executed instructions in memcmp only requires two cache lines, getting up to 99% coverage requires 41 lines, or 2.6 KiB of cache capacity. Not only is more than 50%<br>of code cold, but it is also interspersed between the relatively hot regions, and likely unnecessarily brought in by prefetchers. Such bloat is costly – performance counter data collected by GWP indicates that <strong>8.2% of all i-cache misses among the 100 hottest functions are from memcmp alone</strong>.<br>A closer look at the actual code from glibc can explain the execution patterns in Figure 13. It is hand-written in assembly and precompiled, with <em>extensive manual loop unrolling</em>, <em>many conditional cases</em> for the various alignments of the two source arrays, and <em>large jump tables</em>.<br>In our experience, code usually evolves into similar state from <strong>over-reliance on micro-optimization and micro-benchmarking</strong>. </blockquote> I think there is a much larger discussion that needs to happen as to how we evaluate the performance of a given benchmark when also trying to incorporate the native code-size into this equation, but that discussion is probably far off into the future, given the state of reporting in this area.<br><strong>This is a situation I'd like to improve upon.</strong>  I'd personally like to become more in-tune to the amount of machine code generated as part of my benchmarks and code that I write, and in particular benchmark with BDN, on a per benchmark basis.  In other words, I'd like to start collecting this information through a new Diagnoser that would be part of BDN in the future. This diagnoser would use one of the available diagnostics packages (I assume this would be ClrMD) and would be able to report the amount of native code JIT'd per module/process for each benchmark case.  This data, once reported and reflected in the summary of a benchmark run, could also be scaled compared to the baseline of the benchmark to provide yet another ratio of amount of generated native code.  Working on this diagnoser might be related to, or independent of <a class=""issue-link js-issue-link"" data-error-text=""Failed to load title"" data-id=""525961627"" data-permission-text=""Title is private"" data-url=""https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1316"" data-hovercard-type=""issue"" data-hovercard-url=""/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1316/hovercard"" href=""https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet/issues/1316"">#1316</a> (I tend to think that it is actually independent of it) but it's worthwhile to mention its existence in this context.  I'd like to hear the thoughts of BDN maintainers/users about this before jumping into implementing something like this as a full-blown diagnoser (I'll probably do a hacked out version in the meantime in my own code if I manage to do so).

"NLog/NLog","https://github.com/NLog/NLog","https://github.com/NLog/NLog/issues/1486","Use Ansi Color Codes for ColoredConsoleTarget on Linux/.Net Core · """," Thanks a lot for already providing a beta for .Net Core RC2. It already works pretty cool!  I would love to use the ColoredConsoleTarget on Linux. Unfortunately the output is on my Linux box identical with the normal ConsoleTarget, thus no colors. I guess because Console.ForegrondColor and friends are quite different on Linux, of even not implemented on those platforms. Looking at Microsoft's own Aspnet Core Logger they make a distinction between Windows and Non-windows. On Non-Windows they use the regular System.Console class too, but use Ansi Color codes as message prefix instead of using Console.ForegrondColor. See here <a href=""https://github.com/aspnet/Logging/blob/dev/src/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console/Internal/AnsiLogConsole.cs"">https://github.com/aspnet/Logging/blob/dev/src/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console/Internal/AnsiLogConsole.cs</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/aspnet/Logging/blob/dev/src/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console/ConsoleLogger.cs"">https://github.com/aspnet/Logging/blob/dev/src/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console/ConsoleLogger.cs</a>.  Probably Nlog should do something similar. I guess using Ansi Color Code is also slightly faster..  Regards and thanks a lot for your work.<br>Jens ","C#"

When we put it up on our elasctic beanstalk and take down the database connection it uses to log the application begins to slow down to a turtle pace an AWS beanstalk reports the application is unhealthy.  When, we go through and bring the database back up for the nlog the application becomes healthy and starts working fine.  A side note is that nlog own internal logging is not turned on meaning I did not set any attributes for the internal logging.  My questions are if nothing is set for internal logging will it still attempt to log?  If so is there a way to shut that off? would that be causing this issue of the server crashing when it can't hit the database? Are there other reasons why nlog would cause the crashing of the application when it can't hit the server database?  Keep in mind the logging database server is separate from the application database server.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Angela ","C#"

The test is running under <code>dotnet test</code> and thus the child<br>process gets assigned to dotnet's job object for process reaping.  However, IIS<br>Express maintains its own job object for the process it spawns and the dotnet<br>job object assignment interferes with IIS Express' use of its job objects.  This occurs on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 because those versions of<br>Windows do not support nested jobs.  The fix taken here is to limit the use of job objects for process reaping to<br>Windows 8 / Windows Server 2012 or later.  This is done with an explicit OS<br>version check because there is no change to the Job Objects API to enable<br>support for nested jobs and thus no other way to determine if the feature is<br>available to us.

A Query is a collection, with the notion of deferred evaluation being dropped, meaning every operation like Where, Select, Concat, etc... is executed right away.  A Query is backed by a simple array, allowing most operations to be coded in a very efficient way that is cache coherent.  This also makes new operations easier to write, since they can be written in a familiar imperative style.  This also supports operators that would have been impossible in the previous system, like Reverse, or OrderBy.  Since the Query is backed by an array, these types of operations are trivial to implement.  In addition, operations like Last or Count needed to evaluate the entire collection previously, which was an O(n) operation.

This makes interactions visually inconsistent with the physical capsules driving them!  With this issue we are primarily concerned with the best solution for a hand model that seeks to be a <em>skin</em>, rather than some sort of rigid plating on a hand. In this situation, we want to match <em>all</em> joints including and especially the fingertip joint, even if it means squishing the mesh. After all, the fingertips are arguably the most important part of the hand to match when interacting with physical bodies, especially with small elements.  To facilitate this, we should stretch bones along their length axis in the RiggedFinger script rather than setting their root positions to match the tracked finger. Some manual experimentation has shown promising results for this, and this way fingertips can be made to match perfectly with the tracked hand. ","C#"

If the <code>IRequestHandler</code> declines to handle a resource it can optionally be handled by the <code>IRequestContextHandler</code>, if any, associated with the loading context.</li><li>The <code>OnProtocolExecution</code> callback has been moved from <code>IRequestHandler</code> to <code>IResourceRequestHandler</code> and will be called if a custom scheme request is unhandled.</li><li>Cookie send/save permission callbacks have been moved from <code>IRequestHandler</code> and <code>IResourceHandler</code> to <code>IResourceRequestHandler</code>.</li><li>New methods added to <code>IResourceHandler</code> that better match NetworkService execution sequence expectations. The old methods are now deprecated.</li><li>New methods added to <code>IRequest</code> and <code>IResponse</code>.</li><li>All pending and in-progress requests will now be aborted when the CEF context<br>or associated browser is destroyed. The OnResourceLoadComplete callback will<br>now also be called in this case for in-progress requests that have a handler.</li><li>The <code>IResourceHandler.Cancel</code> method will now always be called when resource<br>handling is complete, irrespective of whether handling completed successfully.</li><li>Request callbacks that arrive after the <code>OnBeforeClose</code> callback for the<br>associated browser (which may happen for in-progress requests that are aborted<br>on browser destruction) will now always have a non-nullptr <code>IBrowser</code><br>parameter.</li><li>Allow empty parameters to <code>IRequest</code> and <code>IResponse</code> methods where it makes<br>sense (e.g. resetting default response state, or clearing a referrer value).</li><li>Modifying the URL in OnBeforeResourceLoad causes an internal redirect response.</li><li>In cases where the request is cross-origin (containing a non-null ""Origin""<br>header) the redirect response must include the ""Access-Control-Allow-Origin""<br>header, otherwise the request will be blocked.</li><li>For 303 redirects all request methods except HEAD are converted to GET as per<br>the latest http draft. For historical reasons the draft also allows POST<br>requests to be converted to GETs when following 301/302 redirects. Most major<br>browsers do this and so shall we. When a request is converted to GET any POST<br>data should also be removed.</li><li>Use 307 redirects instead if you want the request to be repeated using the same<br>method and POST data.</li></ul><h3>API changes:</h3><ul><li>Add <code>IResourceRequestHandler</code></li><li>Add <code>ICookieAccessFilter</code></li><li><code>IRequestHandler.OnBeforeResourceLoad</code> moved to <code>IResourceRequestHandler.OnBeforeResourceLoad</code></li><li><code>IRequestHandler.OnResourceRedirect</code> moved to <code>IResourceRequestHandler.OnResourceRedirect</code></li><li><code>IRequestHandler.OnResourceResponse</code> moved to <code>IResourceRequestHandler.OnResourceResponse</code></li><li><code>IRequestHandler.GetResourceResponseFilter</code> moved to <code>IResourceRequestHandler.GetResourceResponseFilter</code></li><li><code>IRequestHandler.OnResourceLoadComplete</code> moved to <code>IResourceRequestHandler.OnResourceLoadComplete</code></li><li><code>IRequestHandler.OnProtocolExecution</code> moved to <code>IResourceRequestHandler.OnProtocolExecution</code></li><li><code>IRequestHandler.GetAuthCredentials</code> signature change, <code>IFrame frame</code> replaced with <code>string originUrl</code></li><li><code>IDragHandler.OnDraggableRegionsChanged</code> now includes the <code>IFrame</code> param</li></ul><h3>Cookie Handling</h3><ul><li>Cookies are access is now handled using <code>ICookieAccessFilter</code> which is returned using <code>IResourceRequestHandler.GetCookieAccessFilter</code></li><li>Removed <code>IRequestHandler.CanGetCookie</code></li><li>Removed <code>IRequestHandler.CanSetCookie</code></li><li>Removed <code>IResourceHandler.CanGetCookie</code></li><li>Removed <code>IResourceHandler.CanSetCookie</code></li><li>Removed <code>ICookieManager.CreateManager</code></li><li>Removed <code>ICookieManager.GetBlockingManager</code></li><li>Removed <code>ICookieManager.SetStoragePath</code></li><li>Removed <code>IRequestContextHandler.GetCookieManager</code></li><li><code>IRequestContext.GetDefaultCookieManager</code> renamed to <code>IRequestContext.GetCookieManager</code></li><li><code>ICookieManager.SetSupportedSchemes</code> has additional <code>bool includeDefaults</code> param.</li></ul><h3>Request/Scheme Handling</h3> The <code>IRequestHandler</code> interface has been rewritten as the <code>CEF API</code> changed <ul><li>Ability to <code>Seek</code> within a stream has been added</li><li>Instead of implementing <code>IRequestHandler</code> directly it's reccomended for most cases to inherit from <code>RequestHandler</code> and override <code>ProcessRequestAsync</code>.

The original problem that lead me to investigating this, is documented in detail here:  <a rel=""nofollow"" href=""https://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/3996"">https://nuget.codeplex.com/workitem/3996</a>  The crux of it is that R# &lt; v8.2.3 has been causing the current version of NuGet to misbehave.  This mis-behaviour as I mentioned is fully documented , and now resolved with the most recent R# install.  However following on from that documented issue (As you'll see in my last post) I'm still having an issue with CefSharp itself. <h1>Symptoms</h1> When installing from NuGet everything appears to install correctly, however when closing the NuGet GUI there are no references to CefSharp in my project, and any attempt to ""using"" the libraries, or include them in any code leads the visual studio compiler to error with a report that the CefSharp libs cannot be found.  A manual exploration of the projects package folder confirms that the following three packages have been downloaded:  cef.redist.3.1750.1738  CefSharp.Common.33.0.0  CefSharp.WinForms.33.0.0  These 3 packages have been unzipped into the packages folder and the files within the various folders suggest that everything needed is present.  There are no messages in the Package Manager console output or Visual Studio Error logs. <h1>To Reproduce</h1><ol><li> Start up visual Studio (I'm currently using VS2013 Ultimate with Update 3) </li><li> Create a new WinForms project targeting .NET V4.5 </li><li> Add a panel and a couple of buttons to the form (Not really important at this stage as not used) </li><li> Right click on project, open NuGet, search for 'cef' </li><li> Install the 3 packages above, one at a time in the following order.  cef.redist, cef.common, cef.winforms </li><li> In the form class/code add ""using CefSharp;"" to the using's list, you'll see when you attempt to compile that the library is not found, or as in my case R# highlights the using statement in red to show it cannot be resolved. </li></ol> If you want any further help, tweet me @shawty_ds for a direct email address.

The tests run all fine on a wide range of machines and operating systems however there is a single machine out there that is showing us an interesting failure. <h2>The Test Failure</h2> The test in question has a <code>TestCase</code> attribute with a single string argument: <code>[TestCase( ""{\""\"":{\""\ud800\udd51\"":\""team\""}}}}"" )]</code>. The meaning of the string is not relevant for this test and as you can see it contains a <a href=""https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/10151/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Unicode character</a> that is made up of two escape sequences.  This test case works fine on Windows, OSX, and Ubuntu machines with the exception of a single Ubuntu machine that seems to be transforming the <code>TestCase</code> string argument into something invalid. <code>\ud800\udd51</code> shows up as <code>\0\udd51</code> on this particular machine and this is where the head scratching begins.  I wrote a very simple test case to isolate the issue as best as I could and this is how far I got: <div class=""highlight highlight-source-cs""><pre>[<span class=""pl-en"">TestCase</span>( <span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span>{<span class=""pl-cce"">\""\""</span>:{<span class=""pl-cce"">\""\u</span>d800<span class=""pl-cce"">\u</span>dd51<span class=""pl-cce"">\""</span>:<span class=""pl-cce"">\""</span>team<span class=""pl-cce"">\""</span>}}}}<span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span> )] <span class=""pl-c""><span class=""pl-c"">//</span> A</span>[<span class=""pl-en"">TestCase</span>( <span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span>{<span class=""pl-cce"">\""\""</span>:{<span class=""pl-cce"">\""\u</span>d800<span class=""pl-cce"">\u</span>dd51<span class=""pl-cce"">\""</span>:<span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span> )] <span class=""pl-c""><span class=""pl-c"">//</span> B</span>[<span class=""pl-en"">TestCase</span>( <span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span><span class=""pl-cce"">\u</span>6c34<span class=""pl-cce"">\u</span>d800<span class=""pl-cce"">\u</span>dd51<span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span> )] <span class=""pl-c""><span class=""pl-c"">//</span> C</span>[<span class=""pl-en"">TestCase</span>( <span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span><span class=""pl-cce"">\""\u</span>d800<span class=""pl-cce"">\u</span>dd51<span class=""pl-cce"">\""</span><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span> )] <span class=""pl-c""><span class=""pl-c"">//</span> D</span><span class=""pl-k"">public</span> <span class=""pl-k"">void</span> <span class=""pl-en"">StringTest</span>( <span class=""pl-k"">string</span> <span class=""pl-smi"">s</span>) {    <span class=""pl-k"">var</span> <span class=""pl-smi"">j</span> <span class=""pl-k"">=</span> <span class=""pl-smi"">System</span>.<span class=""pl-smi"">Text</span>.<span class=""pl-smi"">Encoding</span>.<span class=""pl-smi"">Unicode</span>.<span class=""pl-en"">GetBytes</span>(<span class=""pl-smi"">s</span>);    <span class=""pl-smi"">Assert</span>.<span class=""pl-en"">AreEqual</span>( <span class=""pl-smi"">s</span>, <span class=""pl-smi"">System</span>.<span class=""pl-smi"">Text</span>.<span class=""pl-smi"">Encoding</span>.<span class=""pl-smi"">Unicode</span>.<span class=""pl-en"">GetString</span>(<span class=""pl-smi"">j</span>) );}[<span class=""pl-en"">Test</span>] <span class=""pl-c""><span class=""pl-c"">//</span> E</span><span class=""pl-k"">public</span> <span class=""pl-k"">void</span> <span class=""pl-en"">StringTest2</span>() {    <span class=""pl-en"">StringTest</span>( <span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span>{<span class=""pl-cce"">\""\""</span>:{<span class=""pl-cce"">\""\u</span>d800<span class=""pl-cce"">\u</span>dd51<span class=""pl-cce"">\""</span>:<span class=""pl-cce"">\""</span>team<span class=""pl-cce"">\""</span>}}}}<span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span> );}</pre></div> Test cases <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, and <code>E</code> all pass and show the correct unicode character in the console summary while test case <code>A</code> fails and shows the following: <pre><code>""{\""\"":{\""\0\udd51\"":\""team\""}}}}""---Expected: ""{"""":{""\0\udd51"":""team""}}}}""But was:  ""{"""":{""\0�"":""team""}}}}""</code></pre> For some reason test case <code>A</code> transforms the high surrogate into a <code>\0</code> and so the second block results in an invalid unicode character (<code>\udd51</code> is invalid). The question here is why and how is this happening? Especially as other tests that use <code>\ud800\udd51</code> pass just fine. <h2>The Machine</h2> As far as I can tell there is nothing out of the ordinary about the machine that is trying to run the tests.

"zzzprojects/GraphDiff","https://github.com/zzzprojects/GraphDiff","https://github.com/zzzprojects/GraphDiff/issues/116","GraphDiff duplicate returned entities · ""","As I've said on <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26935732/graphdiff-duplicate-returned-entities"" rel=""nofollow"">stackoverflow</a>, I have a problem adding new entities to my 'parent' entity's list of children using GraphDiff. I'll try to reproduce my situation and show the problem.  I have an entity called <code>FilterTemplate</code> that has a list of <code>FilterConditions</code>. So in reality the class <code>FilterTemplate</code> has a list of <code>FilterConditions</code> and the class <code>FilterCondition</code> has an attribute  <code>public virtual FilterTemplate FilterTemplate { get; set; }</code>  and EntityFramework does the rest for me. The list of <code>FilterConditions</code> can change as the user may add, update or delete conditions but I don't know exactly what and that's why I need GraphDiff.  Classes: <pre><code>public class FilterTemplate{    public FilterTemplate()    {        this.FilterConditions = new List&lt;FilterCondition&gt;();    }    public int Id { get; set; }    public string TemplateName { get; set; }    public virtual ICollection&lt;FilterCondition&gt; FilterConditions { get; set; }}public class FilterCondition{    public int Id { get; set; }    public int FilterTemplateId { get; set; }    public string Name { get; set; }    public string Value { get; set; }    public virtual FilterTemplate FilterTemplate { get; set; }}</code></pre> For example, I have exactly one filterCondition and the user adds another one, then when I want to update the list I call<br><code>dbContext.UpdateGraph(filterTemplate, map =&gt; map.OwnedCollection(ft =&gt; ft.FilterConditions));</code>  This leads me to CollectionGraphNode.Update where variable 'existing' has a list of one item and 'entity' has a list of 2 items with the 2nd having an Id=0. Variable 'dbCollection' gets populated with one filterCondition. When the loop gets to the new filterCondition, AddElement gets called. There as I said before calling ""changeTracker.UpdateItem(updateItem, instance);"" dbCollection has one item and after it two (existing variable has also a child list of 2). When the code gets to  <code>dbCollection.GetType().GetMethod(""Add"").Invoke(dbCollection, new[] {updateItem});</code>  the dbCollections has now 3 items with the last two being exactly the same (similarly in variable existing). From that point onwards the list keeps having my addition as duplicate (with the same new Id) and of course causing a lot of trouble.  Commenting out the line  <code>dbCollection.GetType().GetMethod(""Add"").Invoke(dbCollection, new[] {updateItem});</code>  seems to fix the issue but I don't find it proper to change the code that I honestly don't get completely as drilling down to it will take way too much time. So I was wondering if you are aware that is an issue with the Add logic or if my case's specifics are the cause of the problem. I don't know if more code snippets will help as most of the logic lies with GraphDiff. But if so, let me know. Thanks in advance. ","C#"
