I recommend that ElectricCharge generation be estimated based on full exposure for open solar panels with the powerCurve evaluated for the vessel's current position, plus the generation of any ModuleGenerator parts (e.g. stock RTGs).

Given we have made sure to prefix the fields that hold the doc type / tab aliases, I wonder if we shouldn't try and add some preventative measures to try and fix things as changes are made, ie, if someone changes the name of a doc type, do a quick search and replace in the database for ""ncContentTypeAlias: 'OldAliasName'"" and fix the changed entry doing something similar with the tab alias.

Following these updates, any regex based redirects have been failing with a 404 error generated by the browser (not our site's custom 404 page). The only regex redirects that sometimes succeed have the Force Redirect attribute set to true, though results are still very inconsistent.  Unfortunately I didn't test the redirects in the time between updating Umbraco and updating UrlTracker so I can't be sure which update led to the issue.  Any help would be much appreciated!

Another thing to add, is that when this is happening, and you happen to open a window in the main menu (e.g. new game, tools, content manager, etc.) and try to close that, it throws the following exception without allowing me to close the window: <pre><code>NullReferenceExceptionat (wrapper managed-to-native) UnityEngine.Behaviour.get_enabled () &lt;0x00075&gt;at ColossalFramework.UI.UIComponent.get_isEnabled () &lt;0x0001c&gt;at ColossalFramework.UI.UIComponent.Focus () &lt;0x0005a&gt;at ColossalFramework.UI.UIView.PopModal (int) &lt;0x001aa&gt;at ColossalFramework.UI.UIDynamicPanels.Hide (string,int) &lt;0x000f3&gt;at LoadSavePanelBase`1.OnClosed () &lt;0x0006e&gt;at (wrapper dynamic-method) object.DynamicEventWrapper_OnClosed (NewGamePanel,ColossalFramework.UI.UIComponent,ColossalFramework.UI.UIMouseEventParameter) &lt;0x00018&gt;at ColossalFramework.UI.UIComponent.OnClick (ColossalFramework.UI.UIMouseEventParameter) &lt;0x000c8&gt;at ColossalFramework.UI.UIButton.OnClick (ColossalFramework.UI.UIMouseEventParameter) &lt;0x0027f&gt;at ColossalFramework.UI.UIInput/MouseHandler.ProcessInput (ColossalFramework.UI.IInputTranslator,UnityEngine.Ray,ColossalFramework.UI.UIComponent,bool) &lt;0x00bd1&gt;at ColossalFramework.UI.UIInput.ProcessMouseInput () &lt;0x002ba&gt;at ColossalFramework.UI.UIInput.Update () &lt;0x00055&gt;(Filename:  Line: -1)</code></pre> Trying to close it the second time seems to work though and prevents the exception from happening again.

It would be nice to have a RawTagHelper class that would provide similar functionality but for when we want to add raw markup to a view from a static file.  The main use case I have for this is to inject the markup in my SVG image files inline into a View (in my case I use it to inject my site's logo.svg file into my _Layout.cshtml file).  This allows me to keep the SVG file in the images folder and keeps my _Layout.cshtml from getting too cluttered.  It also allows me to remove style declarations from the SVG file itself and apply class names which can then be styled in my site.css file, which gives a huge amount of flexibility.  I was able to implement this RawTagHelper myself and it works perfectly using the following syntax:<br><code>&lt;raw src=""images/logo.svg"" /&gt;</code>  There is one issue however that I mentioned in <a href=""https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/5453"">Issue #5453</a>.  Basically because my TagHelper is not part of the main MVC project the editor tool does not know that my ""src"" attribute should be handled as local file locations so the context menu to pick from the wwwroot folder does not open up.  My implementation of the RawTagHelper is only 30 lines of code and the only thing that would need to be done to add it to the main MVC repo beyond my code would be to update the HTML schema files the <code>.cshtml</code> editor uses and add the <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element and the <code>src</code> attribute to it so the editor would know to display the context menu to select a file from the wwwroot folder.

In the example above, the likelihood is that if following convention your class will be named <code>UserTableViewComponent</code> and the following will throw an error:  <code>@await Component.InvokeAsync(nameof(UserTableViewComponent), new { users = Model.Users })</code>  If we rename our class and manually derive from <code>ViewComponent</code> or decorate with attributes we have a working solution (at the cost of breaking convention):  <code>@await Component.InvokeAsync(nameof(UserTable), new { users = Model.Users })</code>  Would it be possible for the <code>InvokeAsync()</code> method to be aware of convention based usage of <code>nameof</code> and automatically detect and remove <code>ViewComponent</code> from the end of the component name, when specified?  I have seen the generically typed version of <code>InvokeAsync()</code>, but unfortunately razor really doesn't play well with generics in method calls, parsing the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> as HTML tags, leaving you with additional parenthesis:  <code>@(await Component.InvokeAsync&lt;UserTableViewComponent&gt;(new { users = Model.Users }))</code>  This final one seems to probably be the best way to adhere to conventions and not rely on magic strings, yet in every piece of documentation and tutorial I've seen it's plain old <code>InvokeAsync()</code> that's used. Is there a reason why?  Regarding the parameter passing, and taking into the account the above, having used and written TagHelpers in .NET Core (which are absolutely fantastic, by the way!) I can't help feel that the same kind of approach, with parameters automatically converted into kebab-case attributes, would be so much more pleasant to use and interact with in your views. Following the example above, the ideal would seem to be to be able to do something like:  <code>&lt;user-table users=""Model.Users"" /&gt;</code>  If Visual Studio integration and Intellisense could work as well on the above as it did on TagHelpers it'd seem to be a pretty big win for usability and readability in razor views.

This conversion is needed because CachedExpressionCompiler is a generic class on the result type of expression.

Right now I'm working on providing something similar to View Components in current ASP.NET MVC 5 stack and it doesn't seems that hard to implement it in strongly-typed fashion.  The basic idea is that you have ""invoke component"" helper function where you provide the component type as type parameter (which makes it strongly typed), and a lambda function that get component instance as argument and returns components result. Everything is strongly typed, no magic strings and <code>Invoke</code> methods with <code>params object[] args</code>).  Inside our ""invoke component"" function we create instance of our component class (using IOC container) and invoke our passed delegate with this component instance, and basing on a model and view name returned by this delegate we render the HTMLs.  This is simile proof of concept:  The invocation of component in view looks like this: <pre><code>@(Html.Component&lt;FooBarController&gt;(c =&gt; c.Invoke(foo: ""foo"", bar: true))</code></pre> And this is the <code>FooBarController</code> (just a normal controller that returns partial view, it can be also used with <code>Html.Action</code> call): <pre><code>public class FooBarController : Controller{    public PartialViewResult Invoke(string foo, bool bar)    {        var viewName = ... //get view name        var model = ... //get model        return PartialView(viewName, model);    }}</code></pre> And this is the code for <code>Html.Component</code> method (alternative to current <code>IViewComponentHelper.Invoke</code> method): <pre><code>public static MvcHtmlString Component&lt;TComponent&gt;(   this HtmlHelper htmlHelper,   Func&lt;TComponent, PartialViewResult&gt; invokeComponent) where TComponent : class{    var instance = IocContainer.Get&lt;TComponent&gt;();    var result = invokeComponent(instance);    var viewName = ((PartialViewResult)result).ViewName;    var viewPath = ... // resolve path to view file basing on you View location convention and viewName                            var component = htmlHelper.Partial(viewPath, new ViewDataDictionary(((PartialViewResult)result).Model));                return component;    }</code></pre> The code is simplified to just show the idea but I tested it and it's working.  Can we have something similar in ASP.NET MVC 6?  Maybe we could even have razor support like for TagHelpers. For example we could write such directive: <pre><code>@addViewCompoenent ""*, MyApp.ViewComponents""</code></pre> and then this code (""Controller"" or ""Component"" suffix could be omitted, like in C# for attributes): <pre><code>@Component.FooBar(""foo"", bar: true)</code></pre> would be translated under the hood to something like this: <pre><code>@(Html.Component&lt;MyApp.ViewComponents.FooBarController&gt;(c =&gt; c.Invoke(""foo"", bar: true))</code></pre> we would still get IntelliSense when calling <code>@Component.FooBar(""foo"", bar: true)</code> just like for TagHelpers in <code>asp-for</code> arguments.

If you take a look at the implementations and their dependencies, you'll see that there is often no reason for them to be transient. A transient component forces all depending components to be transient as well. Failing to make a depending component with a registration equal or less than the dependency can cause all sorts of ugly bugs. This problem is commonly referred to as <a href=""http://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/06/02/captive-dependency/"" rel=""nofollow"">Captive Dependencies</a>.  There is obviously no problem when transient framework components (with their dependencies) are stateless, because it doesn't really makes any difference whether those components are made captive by a consuming component. But problems will start to appear if that framework component starts to have (mutable) state in a future release. Since that framework component is registered as transient or scoped, it is -in a strict sense- allowed to get state in a future version of the framework. But if a singleton consumer already depended on that component in v1 (and note that this consumer could both be a 3rd party library component or an end-user component), the application will suddenly break when the user upgrades to the next version. These types of problems are usually pretty hard to track down and are therefore very costly to fix. So although transient components seem to communicate to the world that the component has state, adding state to a framework component in the future can still cause applications to break. So in reality, framework components can never get state if they didn't have that in the initial version.  To mitigate this, framework components should always be registered as singleton and force their dependencies to be singleton as well. This results in a much simpler mental model, because this can model can be communicated clearly to everybody; the rules are much simpler. Problems are much easier to spot, because the rule now is that a component itself can't have any (mutable) state. If it needs state, it should either request that from another component, or query some cache. In case users replace components with their own and make those components transient/scoped, their application will break much sooner.

In fact, what we want is if I can write something like this below when passing a single value by Post at the server side: <pre><code>   public int Post([FromBodyForSingle] string id)   //If I use something like this attribute, ""id"" will be readout directly through the ""Post"" method.</code></pre> And at the client side, I can write: <pre><code>   $.post(""http://localhost:8080/<U+2026><U+2026>"",dataType:""json"",data:{""id"":""1""},<U+2026><U+2026>);   //what if we can keep the ""id"" here to map the parameter name defined in my method, to make it empty is really an ugly thing....</code></pre> In my mind, the design would be better if: <ol><li>""FromBodyForSingleAttribute"" is a new attribute ONLY FOR a single variable passed by ""Post"" to a Web Api's method.</li><li>""FromBodyAttribute"" will actually pass a json object by ""Post"" to a Web Api's method.</li><li>""FromBodyAttribute"" can only be used once in a method parameters, ""FromBodyForSingleAttribute"" can be used many times.</li></ol> I'm not sure whether this situation also happens in FromUriAttribute?

The token is placed in a hidden field and this is submitted along with the rest of the form data. On the server AntiForgeryTokenStore extracts the token from both the form and from the cookie to allow for comparison.  It is becoming common practice that data is submitted in JSON format over a POST request. This behaviour is supported by MVC currently using the [FromBody] attribute for model binding. The token can easily be extracted client side by taking the value from the form field and including it in the post. However there is no way to instruct the AntiForgeryTokenStore to take its value from the body of the post and not from the form collection.  My approach would be to create a new implementation of ITokenStore which could take its value from a JSON payload in the body. However ITokenStore is marked internal. It would be nice if this interface could be exposed as an extension point. It seems odd that FromBody is supported but in doing so there is no way to use anti-forgery tokens. ,1131,617,Functional Aspects - Feature Enhancement,Feature request/enhancement - Feature request/enhancement already implemented or not needed

Because it's void returning, it has to be invoked inside a code block (@{ }) which isn't particularly discoverable.</li><li>Awaiting the flush (which is definitely the right thing to do given it's current implementation) causes the view rendering to pause until the flush completes. Typically, the flush will actually be synchronous and the method will return immediately, as it's simply copying the bytes down to the next buffer in the stack (e.g. the TCP/IP outgoing buffer), and in those cases, this is fine. However, sometimes, it will be async, and when that happens, the view effectively stops processing until the flush has completed.</li></ol> The proposal is to add a new, string returning <code>Flush</code> method to the view (the returned string would be null/empty and is only to allow the simplified call site). This method would attempt a <code>FlushAsync</code> call inline and if it returned synchronously would do nothing more. If it returned async however, it would return back to the view immediately, while managing the completion of the flush along with coordination with any subsequent calls to <code>Flush</code> by the view. This way, the view continues to process even though an async flush may currently be in progress. The number/size of outstanding flush operations should be limited so that back-pressure can still be honored, in which case the call to <code>Flush</code> would block. At the end of the view processing, it would async wait for all outstanding async flush operations until continuing on with response processing.  As an example, the view might now look like this: <div class=""highlight highlight-text-html-basic""><pre>&lt;!doctype html&gt;&lt;<span class=""pl-ent"">head</span>&gt;    &lt;<span class=""pl-ent"">title</span>&gt;Flushy&lt;/<span class=""pl-ent"">title</span>&gt;    &lt;<span class=""pl-ent"">link</span> <span class=""pl-e"">rel</span>=<span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span>stylesheet<span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span> <span class=""pl-e"">href</span>=<span class=""pl-s""><span class=""pl-pds"">""</span>styles.css<span class=""pl-pds"">""</span></span> /&gt;&lt;/<span class=""pl-ent"">head</span>&gt;@Flush()&lt;<span class=""pl-ent"">body</span>&gt;    &lt;<span class=""pl-ent"">h1</span>&gt;My Flushy Page&lt;/<span class=""pl-ent"">h1</span>&gt;    &lt;<span class=""pl-ent"">h2</span>&gt;First Set of Items&lt;/<span class=""pl-ent"">h2</span>&gt;    &lt;<span class=""pl-ent"">ul</span>&gt;        @foreach (var item in await Model.Items1.ToListAsync()) {            &lt;<span class=""pl-ent"">li</span>&gt;@item&lt;/<span class=""pl-ent"">li</span>&gt;        }    &lt;/<span class=""pl-ent"">ul</span>&gt;    @Flush()    @* This second Flush() will get queued behind the first Flush() if the first was async and is still in progress *@    &lt;<span class=""pl-ent"">h2</span>&gt;Second Set of Items&lt;/<span class=""pl-ent"">h2</span>&gt;    &lt;<span class=""pl-ent"">ul</span>&gt;        @foreach (var item in await Model.Items2.ToListAsync()) {            &lt;<span class=""pl-ent"">li</span>&gt;@item&lt;/<span class=""pl-ent"">li</span>&gt;        }    &lt;/<span class=""pl-ent"">ul</span>&gt;&lt;/<span class=""pl-ent"">body</span>&gt;</pre></div>",4055,1694,Functional Aspects - Feature Enhancement,Feature request/enhancement - Feature request/enhancement already implemented or not needed

This produces as stable an order as Linq's <code>OrderBy()</code> -- leaves the properties in their original order.  But the order isn't predictable because the CLR doesn't guarantee an order the <code>Type.GetRuntimeProperties()</code> extension method returns properties.  The point may be moot if <code>Type.GetRuntimeProperties()</code> <em>happens</em> to order properties consistently and not by (say) the order they appear in the IL.  But we could ensure a predictable order by adding <code>ThenBy(m =&gt; m.Name)</code> to our current sort (in the <code>ModelMetadata.Properties</code> lazy-init getter)  Some questions: <ul><li>Is this necessary?  That is are properties ordered by name or something equally obvious already?</li><li>Would the additional sorting have any downsides?

Our code also shouldn't care about cookie tokens (old or new) because AntiForgery already contains this logic should abstract this away for us.

With the new dependency injection system, I'm guessing that this will be more meaningful. I wonder what you guys think. <h2>Original Issue</h2><blockquote> I am not completely sure but at first glance, it seems to me that IServiceProvider for DataAnnotations validations is completely ignored in ASP.NET Web API.  Here is a quote from<br>Jeff Handley's blog post (<a href=""http://jeffhandley.com/archive/2010/10/25/RiaServicesValidationContext.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeffhandley.com/archive/2010/10/25/RiaServicesValidationContext.aspx</a>):  ""Consider the scenario where a validator needs to access the database; you certainly wouldn<U+2019>t couple a validation method to your data access layer, would you? Instead, you would make your repository available as a service that your validation method can consume in a loosely-coupled manner. In order to easily support these scenarios, ValidationContext implements IServiceProvider. This interface requires a single method, GetService(Type). Using GetService, a validation method can access your repository without knowing how to instantiate or initialize it.""  Here is the Validate method of the DataAnnotationsModelValidator class: <pre><code>  public override IEnumerable&lt;ModelValidationResult&gt; Validate(ModelMetadata metadata, object container)  {      // Per the WCF RIA Services team, instance can never be null (if you have      // no parent, you pass yourself for the ""instance"" parameter).      ValidationContext context = new ValidationContext(container ?? metadata.Model, null, null);      context.DisplayName = metadata.GetDisplayName();      ValidationResult result = Attribute.GetValidationResult(metadata.Model, context);      if (result != ValidationResult.Success)      {          return new ModelValidationResult[] { new ModelValidationResult { Message = result.ErrorMessage } };      }      return new ModelValidationResult[0];  }</code></pre> It would be great to inspect the global DependencyResolver and see whether there is any IServiceProvider type registered. If so, you can pass that into ValidationContext instead of passing null.  I am completely unsure if this is possible to implement because at the first glance, it seems that the validation part doesn't have any knowledge of the HttpConfiguration.  Also, this would be much more useful for the IValidatableObject validation. A sample use case scenario here is to check an existence of a value inside the database. </blockquote>",2627,1598.5,Functional Aspects - Feature Enhancement,Feature request/enhancement - Feature request/enhancement already implemented or not needed

Now it is absent. (Do not worry about real time datetime, stacktrace and other attributes - If user would need them there is possibility to add them as properties)  There is of course possibility to log bufferized events at once as one big concatenated text, but this is not very attractive since there is strong feeling that bufferized event's record should no differ to much from not bufferized (some new custom properties that user can add by himself is OK)...

This seems to work fine: I did a test where several instances of an app were constantly writing consecutive numbers to the same log file, with a small rotation threshold (20kb), and I checked that not a  single number was missed.  Without double-checked locking, or without the solution altogether, there were large gaps.

The HTML prints just fine. The problem is the print dialog box pops up and I can't find anything in the API to be able to print without the dialog popping up?  We are currently using the IE browser control for printing HTML but we always seem to run into problems with it so I am looking for other solutions and CefCsharp looks promising except there does not appear to be a way to do it without the dialog box.  I really think this is something many developers would find extremely useful so is there a way to expose some kind of API to allow for programmatic printing to the default printer? ,715,356.3333333,Functional Aspects - Feature Request,Feature request/enhancement - Feature request/enhancement already implemented or not needed
